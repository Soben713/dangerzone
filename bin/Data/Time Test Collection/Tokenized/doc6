is
a
popular
hero
to
most
of
themillions
who
have
followed
him
since
independence
was
won
in
1956
butbourguiba
also
has
his
deadly
enemies
last
week
a
determined
group
ofthe
latter
almost
succeeded
in
assassinating
tunisia
s
stockychieftain
the
plotters
actually
made
two
attempts
on
bourguiba
s
life.
the
first
try
failed
on
dec
15
because
bourguiba
did
not
spend
thenight
at
his
presidential
palace
at
carthage
near
tunis
the
plottersnext
laid
their
plans
for

blurted
thedetails
of
the

that
night
and
on
following
days
more
than
ahundred
plotters
were
jailed
they
proved
to
be
a
handful
of
dissidentarmy
officers
and
some
disgruntled
landowners
but
the
hard
coreseemed
to
be
supporters
of
bourguiba
s
old
foe
the
late
salah
benyoussef
who
lost
a
bitter
struggle
for
control
of
neo
destour
tunisia
s
only
political
party
and
went
into
exile
in
1955

crowds
gathered
to
hear
official
speeches
ofindignation
at
the
attempt
on
bourguiba
s
life
there
seemed
littledoubt
that
he
still
held
the
nation
s
basic
loyalty
but
even
hisclosest
friends
were
concerned
at
the
recent
signs
of

bourguiba
is
also
aware
of
themuttering
of
many
about
the
three
expensive
new
palaces
he
has
recentlybuilt
these
belong
to
the
state
he
retorted
in
his
i

speech
he
added

bitterness

bourguibahas
had
to
knock
heads
together
inevitably
some

by
his

by

a
u.s
.investigatingcommittee
in
1961
agreed
that
bourguiba
was
making
the
right
moves
tosolve
tunis
s
economic
ills
but
warned
that
he
might
be
asking
toogreat
sacrifices
of
his
people
after
last
week
s
brush
with
death
bourguiba
may
go
forward
a
bit
more
slowly
and
can
undoubtedly
drawsome
support
from
the
fact
that
last
month
the
u.s
finally
agreed
togrant

180
