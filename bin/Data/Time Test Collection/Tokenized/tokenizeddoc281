she

ithought
i
could
never

unless
he
was
there
to

ward
told
her
it
was
all
right
for
a
girl
to
sleep
witha
man
for
money
as
long
as
she
did
not
get
the
prostitute
mentality
though
payment
for

ranged
up
to
140

of
which

she
said
i

gaveher
money
but
not
for

it
was
for
my
mother
miss

.christine
said
that
she
took
up
modeling
so
that
she
could
keep
meetinggirls
to
introduce
to
ward
often
when
she
and
ward
were
out
walking
he
used
to
tell
me
which
girl
he
liked
in
a
shop
and
say
go
and
gether
christine
would
introduce
the
girls
to
ward
under
the
guisethat
he
was
her
brother
or
that
he
wanted
to
sketch
them
ward
wouldthen
seduce
the
girls
and
later
discuss
their
talents
with
christine
he
used
to
say
that
was
wonderful
she
said
she
s
good
she
s
not
bad
she
s
fantastic
something
like
that

occasionally
turned
down
once
a
shopgirl
balked
when
he
wantedher
to
go
to
a
party
where
she
would
see
girls
tied
up
and
whipped

time
ward
told
a
young
lady
of
the
utmost
respectability
said
the
prosecutor
that
he
had
a
two

mirror
in
his
flat
throughwhich

later
the
girl
a
tall
brunette
wearing
ski
pants
identified
only
as
a
certain

recalled
telling

kind
of
thing
mydarling

perhaps
the
most
extraordinary
thing
aboutall
this
was
the
unlikely
