in

last

while
a

the
merits
of
a

surface
fleet
manned
by

crews
the
britons
real
feelings
toward
the
multilateral
force
mlf
were
best
expressed
in
a
sardonic
limerick
that
made

of

each
produces

and
the
plan
is
to
fightor
deter
with
all
three
on
one
horse
behind
u.s
efforts
to
sell
mlfwas
the
ill
concealed
fact
that
military
washington
does
not
reallybelieve
in
it
either
privately
the
pentagon
considers
it
at
best
agimmick
to
postpone
proliferation
of
independent

forces
toother
nations
which
it
wants
at
all

to
prevent
or
delay
monstrous
nonsense
charged
with
the
halfhearted
mission
of
winningbritish
support
for
the
5
billion
mlf
was

claude
ricketts
u.s.
deputy
chief
of

operations
who
has
doubled
of

as

multimixmaster
strategically
he
argued
a
force
of

vessels
cruising
europe
s
shallow
coastal

could
noteasily
be
destroyed
by
soviet
submarines
or
aircraft
said
ricketts
each
additional
weapons
system
enhances
the
credibility
of

but
r.a.f
marshal
sir
john
slessor
called
it
monstrousmilitary
nonsense
and
many
other
british
defense
officials
agreed
.the
state
department
s
main
justification
for
mlf
is
not
military
butpolitical
it
is
aimed
primarily
at
satisfying
west
germany
s
demandfor
an
equal
voice
with
britain
and
france
in
nato
s
nuclear
councils
and
the
germans
are
already
pledged
to
match
the
u.s.
s
offer
toshoulder
40
per
cent
of
the
cost
without
british
backing
however
mlf
will
never
get
off
the
drawing
board
the
u.s
is
not
willing
toshare
the
financial
and
political
responsibility
with
germany
alone
.but
the
british
who
are
already
committed
to
building
a
1
billionpolaris
submarine
fleet
by
1970
reply
that
they
cannot
afford
to
pourmore
money
into
anything
as
theoretical
as
mlf
europe
s
most
tellingobjection
to
the
project
is
that
even
if
the
allies
did
chip
in
ultimate
control
of
its
weapons
would
still
rest
with
the
u.s
whoneeds
it
the
kennedy
administration
hopes
nonetheless
to
winbritish
as
well
as
german
support
for
the
force
we
certainly
don
tneed
it
explained
a
high
ranking
administration
official
last
week
nor
do
the
europeans
but
if
it
satisfies
them
i
think
it
is
worthpursuing
if
it
doesn

well
at

we
made
the
offer

obscured
what
