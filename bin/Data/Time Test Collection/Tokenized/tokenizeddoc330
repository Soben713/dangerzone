styx
private
vasily
terkin
was
the
eternal
sadsacha
and
his
fictional
military
exploits

ii
russians
complained
mightily
whenhis
creator
poet
aleksandr
trifonovich
tvardovsky
failed
to
bring
himhome
from
the
wars
last
week
to
their
delight
vasily
was
back
witha
difference
the
soldier
s
return
was
chronicled
in
a
subtle
stylishnew
poem
by
tvardovsky
that
was
spread
across
two
pages
of
izvestiaunder
a
warmly
approving
introduction
by
editor
aleksei
adzhubei
khrushchev
s
son
in
law
in
stalin
s
day
for
all
his
buffoonery
terkin
ultimately
had
to
symbolize
the
ideal
soviet
soldier
inhis
latest
adventure
he
is
a
cockily
irreverent
figure
who
gets
killedin
battle
and
goes
to
a
nether
world
that
turns
out
to
be
a
sort
ofstalinsville
on
the
styx
hell
terkin
finds
is
like
the
moscowsubway
only
lower
it
is
run
by
a
pampered
army
of
bureaucrats
who
spend
their
days
playing
dominoes
and
yelling
at
the
inmates
tokeep
out
of
their
way

without

.there
is
even
a
magazine
editor
who
sweats
all
over
as
he
puts
inquotes
and
takes
them
out
again
and
reads
each
page
from

from

says
one
big
brotherly
ghost
you
don

to
talk
you
don
t
have

terkin
finally
managesto
escape
and
wakes
up
in
a
hospital
on
earth
where
doctorsconfidently
predict
that
he
will
live
to
be
100
the
moral
of
terkin
strip
tvardovsky
suggests
is
that
all
russians
share
the
blame
forstalin
because
they
resigned
themselves
to
his
excesses
instead
ofresisting
them
however
the
poet
also
urges
russians
to
stop
harpingon
stalinism
which
has
been
khrushchev
s
line
of
late
terkin
sresurrection
was
a
sign
that
khrushchev
had
decided
to
soften
acampaign
against
controversial
writing
that
has
been
going
on
sincedecember
in
