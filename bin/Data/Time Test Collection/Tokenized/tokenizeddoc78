trying

worth
all

african
university
students
on
communist
scholarships
marched
downsofia
s
lenin

toward
the

zhivkov
toprotest
government
restrictions
instead
of
sympathy
they
were
met
by600
bulgarian
militiamen
who
flailed
the
africans
with
clubs
andhauled
them
off
to
jail
all
the
students
had
asked
for

permissionto
maintain
an
all
africa
student
union
like
other
africans

the
350

with
thebulgarian
