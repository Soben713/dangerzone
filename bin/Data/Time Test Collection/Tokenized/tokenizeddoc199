leap
forward
with

the

with
the
first
cargo
shipped
from

to

one

four

later
the
pride
of
china

fleet
lay
onthe
ocean
floor
the
chinese
crew
who
took
to
the
lifeboats
and
wererescued
by
japanese
fishermen
excitedly
insisted
in
sign
language
thattheir
ship
had
been
pursued
by
a
submarine
and
hit
by
three
torpedoes
.but
to
japanese
naval
authorities
their
story
seemed
as
full
of
holesas
the
leap

herself
if
the
ship
had
really
been
torpedoed
