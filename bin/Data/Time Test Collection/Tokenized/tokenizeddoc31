the
warning
on
the
walls
an
old
chinese
proverb
says
where
there
is
an
excess
of
ceremony
there
is
sure
to
be
deceit
inred
china
last
week
ceylon
s
visiting
prime
minister
mrs
sirimavobandaranaike
sniffed
incense
was
wined
and
dined
by
premier
chouen
lai
and
was
even
taken
to
see
a
relic
of
buddha
s
tooth
reasonfor
the
indulgent
treatment
was
the
set
of
proposals
that
mrs
.bandaranaike
brought
to
peking
as
spokesman
for
the
six
nonalignednations
ghana
egypt
indonesia
burma
cambodia
and
ceylon
who
met
incolombo
last
month
and
took
it
upon
themselves
to
arbitrate
the
bloodyhimalayan
border
dispute
between
china
and
india
the
neutrals
solution
delighted
the
chinese
for
it
set
up
a
demilitarized
zonealong
the
himalayan
frontier
and
actually
gave
red
china
more
territoryin
india
than
it
had
occupied
before
its
sudden
invasion
last
october
.expecting
at
least
a
token
condemnation
of
chinese
aggression
from
itsold
neutralist
cronies
india
was
to
say
the
least
disappointed
innew

mrs

after
her
ten
day
sojourn
in
china
but
did
not
reject

outright
nehru
still
hopes
to
gain
time
to
build
up
hisshattered
armed
forces
too
much
delay
however

try

spatience
still
scratched
on
many
buildings
in
the

is
theominous
warning
left
by
