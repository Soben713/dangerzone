china
came
to
an
end
.the
result
had
been
a
foregone
conclusion
since
the
ignominious
frenchdefeat
by
the
communist
viet
minh
at
dienbienphu
two
months
earlier
.even
before
that
diplomats
from
nine
nations
halfway
round
the
worldin
geneva
had
been
working
feverishly
to
hammer
out
the
final
peacesettlement
fearful
that
highlevel
participation
in
geneva
might
putthe
u.s
in
the
position
of
approving
a
sellout
to
the
reds
presidenteisenhower
and

diplomats
argued
over
how
indo
china
should
be
partitioned
whendiscussions
appeared
to
be
getting
nowhere
mendesfrance
imposed
adeadline
after
which
he
threatened
to
resign
a
move
that
would
havebrought
the
conference
to
a
grinding
halt
and
continued
a
war
thatcould
not
be
won
prodded
by
this
ultimatum
the
conference
finallyagreed
on
terms
that
would
partition
viet

this
with
the
argument
