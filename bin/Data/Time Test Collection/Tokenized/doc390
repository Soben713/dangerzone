often
wished

not
dared
to
mete

to
red
envoys
.almost
from
the
day
of
the
congo
s
independence
in
1960
the
russiansand
their
satellites
worked
doggedly
to
destroy
what
little
stabilitythe
country
had
in
hopes
of
getting
a
communist

what
worried
the
government
most
was
the
close
contact
of
the
tworussians
with
a
plotting
exile
group
led
by
lumumba
s
former
partychief
christophe
gbenye
who
made
his

across

congoriver
in

congolese
policeinsisted
on
a
search
with
a
shrug
the
russians
opened
the
trunk
then
let
them
look
in
the
front
and
back
seats
but
voronin
wasclearly
determined
not
to
give
up
his
briefcase
and
hugged
it
to
hischest
as
he
and
miakotnykh
got
back
into
the
car
to
make
sure
therussians
did
not
try
to
start
the
engine
and
speed
away
the
police
letthe
air
out
of
their
tires
then
pulled
open
the
doors
and
began
a
tugof
war
with
voronin
s
legs
yanking
his
shoes
off
in
the
process
asthey
pulled
miakotnykh
clung
just
as
fiercely
to
voronin
until
atlast
both
men
were
dragged
out
feet
first
relieved
of
the
briefcaseand
heaved
unceremoniously
into
a
pickup
truck
when
one
of
therussians
tried
to
stuff
a
document
inside
his
shirt
a
congolese
guardripped
the
entire
front
of
his
shirt
off
out
in
the
rain
with
that
the
prisoners
were
driven
off
to
a
military
camp
outside
leopoldville
and
the
contents
of
voronin
s
briefcase
were
taken
to
policeheadquarters
sure
enough
claimed
the
government
among
them
was
aletter
from

one
of
the
letters
bore
teeth
marks
as
if
a
russian
hadtried
to
swallow
it
to
put
an
abrupt
stop
to
such
soviet
activities
squads
of
congolese
police
were
rushed
to
cordon
off
the
russians
apartments
and
inside
the
russians
suddenly
discovered
themselveswithout
telephone
service
and
without
electricity
which
meant
theywould
have
to
swelter
in
the
heat
without
