wreck
nearyokohama
as
far
as
anyone
could
determine
both
tragedies
resultedfrom
faulty
cotter
pins
only
an
inch
or
two
long
at
the
mikawa
mineon
southern
kyushu
island
a
cotter
pin
apparently
fell
out
of
acoupling
on
a
string
of
coal
cars
halted
on
a
slight
incline
one
coalcar
rolled
back
down
into
the
mine
gathering
speed
it
flew
off
thetrack
on
a
curve
in
the
tunnel
and
struck
the
mine
wall
showering
thefatal
sparks
that
ignited
coal
dust
in
a
vast
explosion
at
tsurumi
outside
yokohama
another
cotter
pin
evidently
sheared
off
the
wheelhousing
of
a
southbound
freight
car
the
loose
lost
wheel
caused
thelast
three
cars
to
derail
and
sprawl
across
the
adjacent
track
.seconds
later
alerted
by
a
warning
flare
a
passenger
train
southboundfrom
tokyo
halted
on
a
clear
track
beside
the
freight
at
that
moment
a
northbound
commuter
train
roared
up
the
middle
track
the
locomotivecrashed
into
the
derailed
freight
cars
did
a
right
angle
flip
andsliced
through
the
fifth

six
coaches
of
the
passenger
train
thefirst
rescuers
recoiled
from
the
carnage
recalled
one
there
werebodies
piled
four
to
six
deep
there
were
legs
arms
and
heads
tornoff
all
bloody
scattered
everywhere
it
was
a
horrible
human
versionof
a
doll
repair
shop
with
national
elections
being
held
this
week
the
socialist
opposition
hurriedly
tried
to
make
political
capital
ofthe
tragedies
an
official
socialist
statement
blamed
the
government
which
operates
the
railways
and
the
private
owners
of
the
mine
for
having
placed
too
much
emphasis
on
efficiency
and
profit
and
not
enoughon
the
safety
and
security
of
passengers
and
employees
the
mineowners
who
used
to
boast
to
foreign
visitors
that
the
mikawa
was
an
underground
palace
could
have
retorted
that
government
inspectorshad
found
mikawa
to
be
among
the
bestequipped
mines
in
the
country
.the
government
could
point
out
that
the
stretch
of
track
where
thecollision
occurred
was
equipped
with
modern
safety
devices
but
theyproved
useless
because
the
entire
chain
of
events
from
the
derailmentof
the
freight
cars
to
the
arrival
of
the
third
train
took
less
than30
seconds
few
japanese
had
heart
to
enter
the
argument
they
weretoo
busy
burying
the
dead
and
worryingabout
the
survivors
of
the
274
hospitalized
