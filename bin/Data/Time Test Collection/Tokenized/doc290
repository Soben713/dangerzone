what
theyare
fighting
aboutat
its
simplest
the
russian
chinese
quarrel
is
over
what
strategy
to
follow
toward
theultimate
victory
of
communism
and
over
who
shall
be
in

ofoperations
but
beneath
this
there
lies
a
far
deeper
split
thesplit
between
communist
theory
and
human
reality

since
karl

that
the

would
break

such

actually
lenin

even

had
argued
both
ways
atvarious

on
conditions
and
moscow
pointed
out
thatconditions
were
certainly
different
