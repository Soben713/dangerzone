must
reckonwith

rate

there
is

the
outlook
painstakingly
kenyatta
pleads
with
hispeople
to
accept
harambee
a
swahili
word
meaning
pull
together
he
tells
africans
that
they
must
concede
full
partnership
to
whites
andasians
and
tells
his
own
dominant
kikuyu
tribe
that
they
must
workamiably
with
other
tribes
the
opposition
kadu
party
which
electedonly
31

130

house
of
representatives
is
falling
apart
asmore
and
more
of
its
own

climb
on
the
kenyattabandwagon
lured
by
government
jobs
and
patronage
as
a
result
kenyawill
probably
become
a
typically
african
one
party
state
but
probablynot
in
so
virulent
a
form
as
ghana
or
guinea
no
one
can
ignore
thedifficulties
ahead
the
uneasiness
of
the
remaining
white
settlers
thefears
of
the
asians
who
control
most
of
the
nation
s
commerce
theage
old
tribal
rivalries
that
could
explode
into
separatism
or
tribalwar
but
the
departing
british
are
greatly
impressed
by
kenyatta
sgrowing
statesmanship
only
we
can
save
ourselves
he
told
hispeople
last
week
nobody
else
can
save
us
in
the
past
we
haveblamed
the
englishman
when
anything
went
wrong
we
said
he
was
suckingour
blood
now
the
government
is
ours
and
now
you
will
blame
kenyatta.
but
you
should
know
that
kenyatta
by
himself
cannot
give
youanything
i
urge
you
to
work
hard
so
that
our
uhuru
will
be
meaningful.
from
today
on
our
motto
will
be
uhuru
na
kazi
freedom
and
work
