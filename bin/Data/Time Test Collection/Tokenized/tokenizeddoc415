with
this
bitter
farewell
hurled
atking

and
at
greek
voters
who
had
ended
his
eight
yearadministration
karamanlis
abruptly
exiled
himself
to
paris
nowatchdog
though
conservative
karamanlis
was
the
ablest
premier
inrecent
greek
history
king
paul
and
queen
frederika
considered
himhighhanded
he
thought
the
same
of
the
queen
they
also
opposed
hisideas
of
reforming
the
constitution
to
give
the
premier
strongerexecutive
powers
in
june
when
they
rejected
karamanlis
advice
tocall
off
a
scheduled
state
visit
to
britain
because
of
possible

he
resigned
and
spent
three

karamanlis
wanted
to
quitthen
but
was
dissuaded
by
his
political
allies
and
the
king
whoconvinced
him
that
as
leader
of
his
majesty
s
loyal
opposition
he
wouldbe
democracy
s
watchdog
but
karamanlis
wanted
to
be
top
dog
and
hegrowled
at
each
new
move
that
boosted
papandreou
s
popularity
the
newpremier
froze

lavishly
promised
all
greeks
a

his
office
once
a
weekto

who
swamped
him
with
gripes
job
requests
even

speed
up
their
divorces
though
anti
communist
papandreou
alsomanaged
to
please
leftists
he
promised
to
free
most
of
the
1
000political
prisoners
in
jail
since
the
end
of
the
communist
civil
warin
1949
he
also
complained
accurately
that
the
greek
defensebudget
amounting
to
5
per
cent
of
its
gross
national
income
is
higherthan
that

the

triumphal
return
thoughsome
economists
hopefully
predicted
that
papandreou
s
spending
spreewill
be
covered
by
rising
national
income
greek
businessmen
wereuneasy
when
king
paul
siding
with
the
new
premier
agreed
topostpone
a
parliamentary
vote
of
confidence
karamanlis
fumed
hecharged
that
in
delaying
the
early
test
of
strength
the
king
wassubmitting
to
blackmail
by
papandreou
who
implicity
threatenedthat
his
defeat
might
cause
political
disorder
and
help
the
left
.finally
karamanlis
summoned
his
closest
political
aide
and
told
him
i
m
retiring
and
leaving
greece
tomorrow
he
booked
space
under
afalse
name
on
a
flight
to
paris
only
after
karamanlis
and
his
wifehad
departed
did
his
national
radical
union
get
the
word
stunned
they
elected
a
new
party
chairman
and
took
whatever
comfort
they
couldfrom
a
letter
their
leader
had
left
behind
when
a
statesman
knowswhat
is
best
for
his
country
but
cannot
carry
it
out
he
must
insteadof
compromising
with
his
conscience
retire
karamanlis
apparentlyhopes
that
if
papandreou
makes
a
mess
of
things
he
can
return
fromexile
in
triumph
in
the
event
of
new
elections
his
supporters
areready
to
campaign
under
the
slogan
bring
karamanlis
back
as
forpapandreou
he
claims
to
be
looking
forward
to
a

ofan
easy
victory
