on
the
fence
with
mlf
field
marshal
viscount
montgomery
ofalamein
has
his
own
ideas
about
the
u.s
proposal
for
a
nato
fleet
ofpolaris
firing
surface
ships
manned
by
crews
of
several
nationalities
utter
and
complete
poppycock
he
cried
in
the
house
of
lordslast
week
how
he
snorted
can
a
ship
fight
effectively
ifone
third
of
its
crew
is
portuguese
one
third
belgian
and
one
third
say
danish
the
thing
is
just
not
on
you
might
as
well
man
aship
with
a
party
of
politicians
many
british
politicians
andmilitary
experts
share
montgomery
s
mistrust
of
the
multilateral
force
mlf
and
its
sponsor
the
u.s
indeed
though
prime
minister
haroldmacmillan
nominally
agreed
at
nassau
last
december
to
support
the
natoforce
his
government
has
been
hoping
ever
since
that
mlf
would
quietlycapsize
of
its
own
complexity
naughty
questions
the
british
approveof
its
primary
aim
to
satisfy
west
germany
s
demand
for
a
bigger
rolein
nato
s
nuclear
defense
but
argue
that
they
cannot
afford
to
buildtheir
own
independent
polaris
submarine
fleet
and
contribute
as
well
tomlf
whose
20
to
25
ships
are
expected
to
cost
5
billion
over
aten
year
period
thanks
to
washington
s
success
in
selling
mlf
togermany
and
then
to
italy
it
seemed
at
first
as
if
the
fleet
might
bebuilt
with
only
a
token
contribution
from
britain
however
when
aldomoro
took
over
as
italy
s
premier
designate
last
month
washingtonrealized
that
his
fragile
government
is
in
no
position
to
honor
itscommitment
to
shoulder
mlf
s
cost
or
even
to
participate
thus
theu.s
which
has
promised
to
contribute
40
per
cent
and
persuadedthe
germans
to
pledge
another
40
per
cent
has
finally
put
pressure
onbritain
to
whitehall
s
dismay
washington
announced
its
top
mlfexpert
admiral
claude
ricketts
deputy
chief
of
naval
operations
would
fly
to
london
this
week
to
discuss
the
government
s
technicalreservations
and
satisfy
british
complaints
that
they
have
so
farreceived
nothing
but
computer
answers
from
the
pentagon
said
onebritish
official
gleefully
we
ve
got
a
lot
of
naughty
questions
compelling
logic
britain
s
main
objection
to
mlf
is
that
it
isprimarily
a
political
scheme
to
promote
nato
solidarity
however
if
britain
decides
not
to
support
mlf
it
faces
one
of
two
unpalatablealternatives
either
the
project
will
be
abandoned
with
thelikelihood
that
the
germans
and
other
european
nations
will
ultimatelydevelop
their
own
nuclear
weapons
or
the
force
will
come
into
beinganyway
and
in
time
may
develop
into
a
truly
european
deterrent
exclusive
of
britain
in
either
case
britain
might
seriously
strainits
ties
with
the
u.s
by
refusing
to
participate
recalling
thatonly
a
few
years
ago
the
government
argued
with
compelling
logicagainst
membership
in
the
common
market
the
sunday
telegraph
concludedlast
week
what
is
so
sad
is
that
once
again
we
seem
to
be
climbingreluctantly
into
a
back
seat
on
the
bandwagon
only
after
it
has
startedto
move
