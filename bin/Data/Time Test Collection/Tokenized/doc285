moise
tshombe
43
was
beingtreated
last
week
in
the
clinique
de
passy
in
paris
at
the
same
time
his
once
potent
and
economically
healthy
domain
of
katanga
was
goingunder
the
knife
back
in
the
congo
last
year
the
congo
centralgovernment
cut
north
katanga
out
of
tshombe
s
former
domain
leavinghim
only
the
southern
part
now
the
government
subdivided

into
the
provinces
of

thepurpose
of
the

is
to
remove
any

tshombemight
return
premier
cyrille
adoula
and
other
central
governmentleaders
in
leopoldville
have
been
terrified
of
a
renewed
secessionattempt
in
katanga
once
u.n
troops
pull
out
of
the
congo
a
personalcampaign
against
tshombe
began
last
may
when
his
bodyguard
was
forciblydisbanded
next
tshombe
s
correspondence
was
seized
with
hints
thatit
gave
proof
of
treasonable
designs
the
ailing
tshombe
took
the
hintand
left
for
europe
vowing
i
will
come
back

notabandon
my
post
technically
moise
tshombe
is
still
eligible
to
runfor
office
in
east
katanga
but
since
much
of
tshombe
s
politicalstrength
lies
with
the
luanda
tribe
now
isolated
in
the
new
lualabaprovince
his
chances
might
be
slim
though
tshombe
still
hasconsiderable
popularity
in
katanga
the
europeans
there
want
no
moreadventures
and
the
flourishing
union
miniere
asks
only
that
it
beallowed
to
mine
copper
undisturbed
and
continue
earning
260
million
ayear
for
the
congo
more
than
twice
the
export
revenue
of
the
rest
ofthe
country
the
secessionist
spirit
seems
to
be
dying
says
one
oftshombe
s
old
ministers
we
were
puppets
protecting
europeaninterests
and
now
nobody
wants
to
pull
our
strings
it
s
all
over
.we
have
no
choice
but
to
accept
the
dictates
of
leopoldville
