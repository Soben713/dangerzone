vouched
for
philby
sgood
character
the
foreign
office
even
asked
the
observer
to
hirephilby
as
a

because
it
seemed
unfair
that
so
able
a
manshould
be
finding

overlookingthe
fact
that
they
had
cottoned

twelve
years
too
late

ofjitters
in

guy
burgess
was
amused
by
the
revelations
inparliament
mark
you
my
dear
boy
he
told
a

thelonger
i
stay
in
the
soviet
union
and
read
about
the
scandals
inengland
the
more
glad
i
am
to
be
here
the
more
i
believe
that
anycivilized
person
like
philby
might
easily
want
to
come
here
butburgess
denied
that
philby
or
anyone
else
had
warned
him
and
macleanthat
they
were
under
suspicion
in

declared
burgess
macleanonly
learned
that
he
was

he
was
ridingin
one
day
was
rammed
in

traffic
accident
by
a
carful
of
britishsecret

agents
summing
up
this
latest
schemozzle
involvingthe
british

burgess
remarked
someone
once
said
there
is
nothing
so
squalid
as
a
patrician
in
a
panic.
the
head
ofbritish
security
is
usually
a
patrician
and
panic
seems
to
beuniversal
back
home
the
tories
might
not
be
panicked
but
theywere
showing
a
bad
case
of
the
jitters
