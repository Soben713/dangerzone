the
mess
in
yemen
the
nasty
little
war
inyemen
one
year
old
this
month
is
dragging
on
in
grand
disregard
forthe
peace
seeking
efforts
of
the
u.n
neither
egypt
nor
saudi
arabiahas
honored
its
pledge
which
both
made
earlier
this
year
under
u.s
.mediation
pressure
to
disengage
simultaneously
from
yemen
althoughnasser
has
sent
home
six
shiploads
of
troops
he
has
rotated
in
freshdetachments
and
at
least
20
000
egyptian
soldiers
are
still
in
yemenpropping
up
the
republican
regime
of
president
abdullah
sallal
allthe
while
money
and
munitions
from
the
monarchies
of

still
pour
across
the
25
mile
wide
buffer
zone
to
royalisttribesmen
supporting
dethroned
imam
mohamed
el
badr
so
far
as
theactual
fighting
is
concerned
it
is
still
a
standoff
with
therepublicans
controlling
the
cities
and
the
plains
and
the
royalistsholed
up
in
and
defending
key
strong
points
in

it
is
all
very
frustrating
for
the

was
rushed
to
the
scene
from
the

two
months
ago
in

to
stop
the
shooting
the
unit
made
up
mostly
of
yugoslavsoldiers
and
canadian
airmen
was
far
too
small
to
police
the
vast
empty
yemen
frontier
and
from
the
start
it
was
plagued
by
bad

hostility
from
