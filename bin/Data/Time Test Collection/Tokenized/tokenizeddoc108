the
victory
was
resoundingproof
of
senghor
s
support
among
senegal
s
masses
and
it
is
made
allthe
more
impressive
by
the
fact
that
he
is

the
outcome
was
also
in

sense
a

for

probably
lost

brooding
over
thepolitical
circumstances
which
forced
him
to
end
his
17
year

and
take
over

was
not
likely
to
lethis

get
him
down
he
is
after
all
a
strong
admirer
ofcharles

partly
on

perhaps
with
