iraquntil
the
next
coup
for
a
while
last
week
it
seemed
impossible
to
tellwho
was
up
and
who
was
down
in
iraq
perhaps
the
principals
themselveswere
not
sure
two
weeks
ago
the
baath
party
time
nov
22
seemedfirmly
in
control
the
country
s
non
baathist
president
field
marshalabdul
salam
aref
seemed
a
mere
figurehead
kept
on
for
his
prestigeand
popularity
then
an
internecine
conflict
erupted
between
baath
santi
western
anti
bourgeois
and
anti
aref
radical
wing
and
a
moreconciliatory
moderate
faction
rushing
in
from
neighboring
syria
thebaath
party
s
home
base
the
party
central
committee
under
michel
aflakappeared
to
settle
the
matter
by
exiling
the
leaders
of
the
opposingfactions
although
syrian
dominated
the
party
leaders
took
charge
iniraq
placed
aref
under
palace
arrest
and
turned
baghdad
over
to
thenational
guard
a
baath
led
outfit
for
which
the
regular
army
hascontempt
when
the
baath
bosses
overconfidently
released
aref
a
fewdays
later
he
promptly
joined
with
angry
fellow
officers
to
head
acoup
at
dawn
one
morning
last
week
the
army
attacked
baghdad
withsix
infantry
battalions
supported
by
armor
artillery
and
jets
.though
the
national
guard
had
no
heavy
weapons
they
foughtdesperately
lost
hundreds
of
men
three
days
after
the
revolt
baghdad
was
in
aref
s
hands
since
the
baath
party
is
nasser
sarchenemy
the
coup
was
at
first
hailed
in
egypt
as
pro
nasser
it
wasalso
denounced
in
syria
as
anti
baath
both
conclusions
may
bepremature
the
coup
looked
more
like
a
military
than
a
politicalaffair
designed
to
purge
iraq
of
baath
elements
who
had
had
thetemerity
to
downgrade
the
army
in
favor
of
the
national
guard
thoughhe
packed
the
syrian
baath
leaders
off
to
damascus
aref
included
inhis
new
cabinet
nine
moderate
baathists
still
the
middle
east
beingwhat
it
is
aref
may
well
join
with
nasser
an
old
friend
to
overthrowthe
baath
leadership
in
syria
even
more
likely
the
baath
leadershipwill
try
to
overthrow
aref
just
about
the
only
certainty
in
thesituation
is
that
there
is
bound
to
be
another
coup
in
baghdad
or
indamascus
if
not
both
