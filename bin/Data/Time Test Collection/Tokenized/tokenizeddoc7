ontrial
on
charges
of

nudge
fromthe

the
imprisonment
of
sheik
abdullah
symbolized
all
ofpakistan
s
deep
distrust
of
nehru
despite
his
outward
devotion
to
theu.n.
no
amount
of
u.n
pressure
could
bring
nehru
to
the
bargainingtable
with
pakistan
over
kashmir
but
when
red
china
thrust
deep
intoindia
s
himalayan
borderland
last
october
nehru
reluctantly
yielded
tothe
insistent
envoys
of
the
u.s
and
britain
who
suggested
that
unlessindia
and
pakistan
settled
their
differences
there
would
be

the

against

.hotheaded

opposed

idea
of

.kashmir
is
not
for

argued
that

domination
where
was
the
room

officially
pakistan
maintained
that
an
overall
plebiscite
is
the
onlysolution
to
the
problem
but
privately
pakistan
has
fallbackpositions
is
willing
to
hold
regional
referendums
that
would
giveindia
both
jammu
and
ladakh
the
real
issue
however
was
kashmir
svale
pakistan
seemed
agreeable
to
the
internationalization
of
theimportant
region
nehru
however
feared
that
secession
of
any
part
ofkashmir
would
encourage
separatist
movements
in
other
indian
stateswith
strong
nationalist
tendencies
nevertheless
indian
officialsshowed
up
in
rawalpindi
for
the
start
of
negotiations
last
week
theywere
prepared
for
almost
any
surprise
but
the
one
that
actually
arrived.
on
the
eve
of
the
conference
pakistan
suddenly
announced
anagreement
in
principle
with
red
china
for
a
complete
settlement
oftheir
mutual
border
differences
to
the
indians
it
was
a
stunningblow
for
it
seemed
that
the
pakistanis
were
deliberately
using
thechinese
bogeyman
to
blackmail
them
into
yielding
better
terms
on
thekashmir
question
after
two
days
of
no
progress
the
rawalpindi
talkswere
adjourned
for
three
weeks
