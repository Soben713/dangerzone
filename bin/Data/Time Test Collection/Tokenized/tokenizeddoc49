is
also
one
of
the
shrewdest
leaders
insoutheast
asia
sihanouk
was
cambodia
s
young
king
until
1955
when
hestepped
down
from
the
throne
to
run
for
elective
office
in
thegovernment
because
the
true
face
of
the
people
was
hidden
from
me
under
his
leadership
cambodia
has
embarked
on
an
ambitious
programof
development

was
the
best
in
memory
and

cambodia
doesnot
have
one

of

but
cambodia
likemany
pleasant
and
languid
places
is
now
beset
by
pressing
economicproblems
the
planned
26
million
deficit
for
this
fiscal
year
hasunexpectedly
doubled
and
the
government
is
so
short
of
cash
that
thecurrent
five
year
plan
is
literally
out
of
money
some
24

of
public
projects
have
had
to
be
canceled

are
dwindling

a

sihanouk
sreaction
was
characteristically
unpredictable
he
purged
hisgovernment
of
its
oldtimers
and
installed
in
their
places
a
group
ofhis
most
fiery
critics
they
are
youthful

paris
trained
intellectuals
whom
sihanouk
sneeringly
calls
their
socialist
majesties
says
sihanouk
i
know
that
they
donot
like
me
they
hate
me
they
have
always
supported
the
communists.
now
i
ve
given
them
the
opportunity
of
supporting
cambodia
for
thefirst
time
i
told
them
you
can
kill

but
you
have
no

behind
sihanouk
s
oddchoice
of

is
an
adroit
policy
with
opponents
in
his
verycabinet
sihanouk
is
able
to
keep
an
eye
on
his
foes
and
to
force
themto
share
blame
for
a
worsening
financial
situation
he
has
allowed
thecabinet
to
slash
government
expenditures
but
vetoed
its
proposal
tonationalize
the
french
rubber
plantations
which
are
a
prime
source
offoreign

the
french
might
be
capitalists
sihanouk
said
but
they
are
capable
he
also
delights
in

not
what

that
a
counterbalance
is
needed
against
the
rising
strength
ofthe
communists
in

asia
but
the
main
object
of
sihanouk
spolicy
is
still
to
maintain
the
joie

of
my
people
i
wantthem
to
work
also
but
not
so
hard
as

we
cambodians
arenot

we
have
to
