russia
a
fine
italian
hand
the
paucity
of
facts
in
moscow
lendsa
certain
credibility
to
every
rumor
about
the
kremlin
especially
whenit
concerns
the
supposed
ups
and
downs
of
nikita
khrushchev.
thus
itwas
last
week
that
a
whisper
from
moscow
via
rome
became
a
blast
of
hotair
felt
around
the
world
it
all
began
with
a
moscow
dispatch
bygiuseppe
boffa
correspondent
for
italy
s
communist
newspaper
l
unita
which
soberly
described
soviet
troubles
in
domestic
and
foreign
affairsand
at
one
point
permitted
itself
the
flat
assertion
that
moscow
isliving
through
a
delicate
and
interesting
political
moment
rome
svolatile
press
erupted
with
screaming
headlines
predicting
nikita
simminent
downfall
big
papers
in
new
york
london
and
paris
gave
way
tosimilar
speculation
though
khrushchev
was
surely
under
pressure
hedid
not
act
like
a
fellow
on
the
skids
he
sent
a
note
to
his
poisonpen
pal
mao
tse
tung
politely
declining
mao
s
invitation
to
talk
overthe
sino
soviet
split
in
peking
time
march

instead
he
invitedmao
or
a
group
of
colleagues
to
moscow
suggested
time
for
theconfrontation
of
quarreling
communists
in
the
spring
or
summer
which
are
good
seasons
of
the
year
in
our
country
even
the
ups
and
downs
of
soviet
space
technologywere
shrouded
in
uncertainty
last
week
moscow
launched
a
fourth
moonprobe
but
with
typical
secrecy
did
not
reveal
its
mission
the
sizeof

some
western
scientists
to
believe
it
wasdesigned
to

but
after

a
flop
