it
was
all
rather
embarrassing.

as

was
gleefully
reporting
the

in
the
heart
of

began
at
midday
near

just
off

two
foreign
students
one
from
africa
and
another
from
themiddle
east
were
out
for
a
stroll
when
they
were
attacked
by
a
gang
of300
czechs
who
pummeled
them
with
fists
and
bunches
of
keys
whilepolice
stood
idly
by
that
evening
another
group
of
young
czechs
beganswinging
at
an
african
walking
with
his
czech
wife
then
picked
a
fightwith
two
more
africans
who
had
been
arguing
with
some
cubans
thistime
police
broke
up
the
brawls
but
not
before

days
later
when

got
around
toreporting
the

complained
that
