espionage
midsummer
dragnet
throughout
the
world
last
week
secret
agents
were
on
the
move
many
of
them
in
the
direction
of
jail
.the
u.s
had
just
rounded
up

you

that
you
could
defeat
the
whole
machinery
of

and
also
in
london
one
of
the
oddest
of
the
spycases
came
to
light
when
the
government
admitted
that
it
was
grantingasylum
to
anatoly
dolnytsin
a
former
senior
russian
intelligenceofficer
who
defected
to
the
west
18
months
ago
and
had
spent
theintervening
time
being
thoroughly
pumped
by
u.s
and
british
agents

the
revelation
that

was
indeed
the
third

who

the
government
had
made
quite
a
show
of
askingthe
british
press
not
to

had

charged
that
this
possibly
endangered
dolnytsin
who
is
somewhere
in
a
british
hideout
and
that
dolnytsin
was
beingunveiled
now
by

in
the
hope
of
claiming
a

many

disasters
fingered

so
many
redspies
are
caught
probably
because
there
are
so
many
more

passion
one
fact
to
emerge
from
the
recent
wave
of

isthat
the
soviet

seems
sentimentally
fond
