an
eclipse
of

clambered
out
of
theirraspberry

plane
at

last

there
were
notophatted

to
welcome
them

which
had
been

of

from

then
they
headed
down

where
they
stayed
at

four
day
stay
made
little
stir
inwest
germany
as
a
whole
but
their
presence
worked
like
champagne
onthe
aristocracy
s
battered
morale
in
a
society
where
most
bluebloodsfeel
that
they
are
displaced
personages
there
hasn

been

1918
the
romantik
of
a
royal
visit
is
rare
indeed
thanks
tothe
nation
s
miraculous
economic
boom
west
germans
today
are
moreconcerned
with
paychecks
than
with
princely
comings
and
goings
butthe
country
s
economic
and
social
transformation
has
failed
notably
toproduce
a
unified
national
fuhrungsschicht
leadership
layer
in
placeof
the
old
aristocratic
ruling
caste
the
result
is
a
confused
andconfusing
society
in
which
says
sociologist
ralf
dahrendorf
there
isnot
one
class
of
prominenz
but
a
multitude
of
competing
groups
the
pyramids
of
power
include
the
church
the
military
localgovernment
and
such
venerable
universities
as
tubingen
gottingen
andheidelberg

the

the

plutocracy
whose
yellow

have
largely
replaced
the
iron

and
thedueling
scar
as

symbols
the
new

is
personified
bysuch
tycoons
as

as

one

yet

all
its

says
sociologist
dahrendorf
the
geldaristokratie
is
searching
aboveitself
in
the
social
hierarchy
for
its
behavioral
standards
but
thespace
above
it
is

this

accounts
for
thejoyless
frantic
materialism
that
characterizes
much
