the
argument
raged
for
five
hours
far
into
the
night
andincluded
several
remarkably
frank
exchanges
with
the
soviet
ruler
oneof
the
first
to
speak
up
was

the

said
but
it
has
the
warm
admiration
ofsuch
eminent
soviet

retortedkhrushchev
scornfully
that

not

wehave
outlived
the
time
when
the
grave
was
used
as
a
means
of

was
stunned
