andannounced
a

set
about

abide
by
his

17
months

torestore

berger
s
lever
was
the
u.s.
s
annual
500
million
aid
program
to
south
korea
without
which
park
sgovernment
could
not
remain
solvent
to
a
steady
stream
of

koreanofficials
who
came
to
the

in

berger
explained
that
the
u.s
might
have
to
re
examine
its
aidprogram

park
let
the

agreeing
to
wait
until
september
todecide
whether
to
call

free
elections
or
a
vote
on
his
referendum
civilian
politicians
were
at
first
inclined
to
grumble
at
park
scompromise
but
in
fact
they
needed
that
much
time
to
organize
theirparties
for
an
election
campaign
the
civilians
knew
who
their
mostpotent
opponent
would
be
general
park
himself
who
no

woulduse
the
six

to
