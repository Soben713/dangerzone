france
encore
non
in
a
20
minute
tv
speech
last
week
charlesde
gaulle
made
his
first
public
address
since
the
historic
jan
pressconference
at
which
he
barred
britain
from
europe
as
the
baroqueparagraphs
unfolded
it
became
plain
that
france
s
president
had
notretreated
from
the
policies
that
have
divided
the
western
alliance
andhalted
the
integration
of
europe
in
the
three
months
since
his
viewson
key
issues
.europe
political
integration
of
europe
would
inevitably
end
in
foreign
domination
of
the
continent
it
would
inany
case
be
incompatible
with
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
frenchrepublic
to
surrender
sovereignty
to
a
supranational
parliament
which
de
gaulle
disdainfully
liked
to
an
areopagus
the
supremecourt
of
ancient
athens
in
short
it
seems
to
us
essential
thateurope
should
be
europe
and
france
france
england
with
all
duerespect
to
the
great
english
people
de
gaulle
firmly
insisted
that
union
of
europe
meaning
apparently
the
gaullist
proposal
forcloser
ties
between
governments
cannot
wait
for
britain
one
day
perhaps
england
will
be
admitted
to
europe
after
it
has
detacheditself
from
its
ties
with
the
commonwealth
and
the
u.s
.the
westernalliance
the
alliance
is
indispensable
so
long
as
the
threats
andambitions
of
the
soviets
continue
while
conjugating
its
defensewith
nato
however
france
intends
to
remain
its
own
master
.nuclear
independence
france
s
force
de
frappe
is
essential
to
dissuade
wouldbe
aggressors
and
contribute
to
the
defense
of
itsallies
including
who
knows
america
for
though
the
americans
are
our
good
allies
as
we
are
theirs
in
the
event
of
nuclear
warthere
is
immense
and
inevitable
uncertainty
whether
russia
and
theu.s
would
use
nuclear
weapons
at
all
or
only
in
europe
or
whetherthe
two
champions
might
not
hurl
death
reciprocally
into
eachothers
vitals
critics
who
say
france
s
deterrent
is
useless
or
tooexpensive
are
in
the
same
category
of
laggards
and
scatterbrains
whocried
no
heavy
artillery
until
1914
and
before
1939
cried
no
armored
corps
no
fighter
aircraft
as
journalists
like
tosay
there
wasn
t
very
much
that
was
new
in
the
speech
but
thereweren
t
any
new
obstacles
either
