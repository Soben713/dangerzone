newly
appointed
commander
of

whoannounced
in
the
yemen
capital
of
san
a
that
his
troops
had
killedthe
imam
and
were
in
control
of
the
primitive
nebraska
sized
country
.weeks
later
it
was
learned
that
badr
had
in
fact
escaped
the
shelledruins
of
his
palace
and
taken
refuge
in
yemen
s
rugged
hill
country
whose
warlike
tribes
have
traditionally
been
loyal
to
the
imam
.clouded

since
helped
by
money
and

nasser

promise
towithdraw
his

egypt
s
president
has
not
only
failed
to
honorhis
pledge
but
has
actually
raised
the
expeditionary

what
is
that
the
tribesmen
s
loyalty
to
the
imam
is
notalways
easy
to
understand
many
of
the
present
royalist
leaderssuffered
cruelly
during
the
14
year
reign
of
badr
s
father
ahmad
thedevil

some
were

some

we
killedthe
bad
ones
sooner

later
and
we
prospered
under
the

another
reason
for
fighting
the
republicans
is
that
the
hill
tribesbelong
to
the
moslem
shia
sect
of
which
the
imam
is
the
religious
head.
the
yemenis
of
the
coast
and
the
south
belong
to
the
rival
sunni
sect
as
do
most
egyptians
though

sallal

it
is
