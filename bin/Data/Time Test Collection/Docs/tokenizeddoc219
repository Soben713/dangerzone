scontinuance
in

in
any
case
he
would
not

changefanfani
s

since
he
himself
was

acceptance

at

s
national
congress
of

in

moro
is
somewhat
less
enthusiastic
thanfanfani
about
economic
planning
and
could
be
expected
to
be
moreoutspoken
about
the
need
to
check
the

moreover
he
mightbe
a

more
popular
where
fanfani
enjoys
