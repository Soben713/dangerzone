it
seems
to
me
says
one
former

that
theevidence
was
pretty
flimsy
the

might
have

point
hirasawainsisted
that
the
repudiated
confession
was
extracted
from
him
bytorture
in

brutal
nonstop
interrogation

positivelyidentified
hirasawa
as
the

and
both
were

unsure
asthe
trial
wore

the
only
clue
pointing
to
hirasawa
was
the
callingcard
of
the
supposed

had

experts
determined
that
the
writing
on

of
the
card
was
hirasawa
s
the
painter
never
denied
that
heonce
had
the

claimed
that

but
the
rapid
turnover
of

ministers
in

has
helped
keep

alive
if

they
could
have
read

and
signed

long
ago
says
