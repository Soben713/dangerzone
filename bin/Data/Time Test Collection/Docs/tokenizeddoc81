.brandt
s
victory
was
no
surprise
for
west
berlin
traditionally
votessocialist
what
was
startling
was
the
size
of
the
socialist
gain
andthe
sharp
loss
suffered
by
the
west
berlin
faction
of
chancellor
konradadenauer
s
christian

lost
to
a
little
known
socialist
and
overall
c.d.u
strengthin
the
berlin
house
of
representatives
dropped
25
per
cent
therewere
of
course
local
issues
but
no
one
doubted
that
the
c.d.u
.suffered
from
the
tarnished
image
of
adenauer
s
national
party
whichhas
been
slipping
in
local
and
state
elections
recent
discontentfocuses
on
the
government
s
clumsy
treason
crackdown
on
thenewsmagazine
der
spiegel
last
november
and
more
important
on
thestubborn
refusal
of
adenauer
to
clear
the
way
for
his
own
retirementand
choice
of
a
new
c.d.u
leader
with
new
national
elections
due
in1965
it
is
none
too
early
for
the
christian
democrats
to
startbuilding
up
a
new
candidate
whether
he
turns
out
to
be
vice
chancellorludwig

the
