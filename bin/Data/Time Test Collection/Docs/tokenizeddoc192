u.s

squeezed
in
a
short
stop
in
belgrade
for
thediplomatic
record
rusk
officially
was
repaying
a
1961
visit
towashington
by
yugoslav
foreign
minister
koca
popovic
but
there
wasmore
to
rusk
s
courtesy
call
than
that
u.s.
yugoslav
relations
werenever
really
warm
since
the
u.s
congress
last
summer
served
noticethat
it
would
eliminate

this
year
they
have
been
positively
chilly
marshal
tito
sostentatiously
friendly
trip
to
moscow
last
year
did
not
improvematters
either
but
belgrade
was
anxious
to
assure
the
u.s
that
itwas
officially
still
unaligned
and
to
smooth
things
over
ruskagreed
at
the
last
minute
to
make
his
visit
popovic
was
out
at
modernsucrin
airport
to
greet
rusk
when
the
big
u.s
jet
touched
down
alsoon
hand
was
a
red
carpet
and
a
military
band
but
that
was
the
end
ofthe
fanfare
since
the
yugoslavs
do
not
unfurl
foreign
flags
along

there
were
no

at

announce

after

it
is
worried
about
the
rising

wallsof
the

naturally
tito
raised
the
problem
of
most
favored
nation
status
which
if
eliminated
could
sharplyboost
import
levies
on
yugoslavia
s
30

trade
with
theu.s
rusk
could
offer
no
assurances
that
the
clause
would
be
restored
since
the
decision
is
up
to

on
the

it
