went
before
the
cameras
fora
television
interview
last
week
it
was
a
masterful
performance
.relaxed
and
confident
macmillan
talked
with
easy
confidence
of
thepromise
and
problems
of
britain
today
off
camera
things
were
notgoing
so
well
as
harold
macmillan
made
it
seem
britain
s
hopes
ofmembership
in
the
common
market
hung
precariously
in
the
balance
.after
the
decisions
at
nassau
a
question
mark
rose
over
the
future
ofits

power
the
latest

many
of
macmillan
s
ownconservative

backbenchers
were
critical
of
the

for
itsinability
to
stop
the
growing
unemployment
in

s
north
.reason
for
confidence
seeking
a
solution
to
the
problem
ofjobs
macmillan
last
week
gave
lord
hailsham
a
new
ministerial
task
ofstudying
the
northeast
depressed
areas
and
told
birmingham
businessmenthat
with
a
little
bit
of
luck
the
economic
slump
might
be
reversedthis
year
as
another
weapon
against
political
decline
macmillan
isclearly
counting
on
admission
to
the
common
market
despite
theoverwhelming
obstacles
ahead
on
tv
he
said
i
believe
that
assoon
as
the
common
market
is
settled
and
as
soon
as
it
is
clear
thatthere
will
not
be
another
socialist
government
you
will
find
thebusinessmen
reinvesting
on
a
bigger
scale
than
ever
before
that
iswhy
i
am
confident
about
1963

decision
on

due

in

.as
fate
would
have
it
the
tories
won
relief
of
sorts
from
the
drumfireof
criticism
at
home
through
a
tragic
happenstance
in
the
labor
party
.hugh
gaitskell
labor
s
capable
hard
working
leader
was
rushed
tolondon
s
middlesex
hospital
suffering
from
pneumonia
double
pleurisyand
severe
periocarditis
in
great
pain
and
scarcely
able
to
breathe
gaitskell
was
allowed
no
visitors
except
his
wife
snap
pressure
.labor
spokesmen
officially
spread
the
news
that
gaitskell
would
be
backat
work
within
five
to
six
weeks
but
medical
men
thought
three
to
sixmonths
more
likely
this
means
he
will
not
be
able
to
lead
labor
sattack
on
britain
s
common
market

in
fact
to
labor
s
acuteembarrassment
the
man
who
becomes
spokesman
in
gaitskell
s
place
isdeputy
leader
george
brown
who
is
as
pro
common
market
as
gaitskell
asanti
the
conservative
sunday
telegraph
paid
tribute
to
gaitskell
bysuggesting
that
without
him
there
can
be
noalternative
government
worth
the
name
some
tories
promptly
urgedmacmillan
to
call
a
snap
general
election
while
labor
is
virtuallyleaderless
but
macmillan
will
almost
certainly
resist
the
pressure
select
his
own
time
between
now
and
october
1964
the
date
by
which
ageneral
election
must
be
held
if
during
the
crunch
of
the
nextfew
weeks
in
brussels
britain
is
admitted
to
the
common
market
on
anapproximation
of
its
own
terms
and
if
the
straitened
economy
revivesas
a
consequence
the
government
would
be
in
an
excellent
position
fora
general
election
in
the
fall
macmillan
who
will
be
69
next
month
said
during
his
tv
interview
that
he
thought
he
could
put
in
anothersix
years
on
the
job
and
added
jokingly
the
question
iswhether
the
people
could
stand
another
six
the
answermay
be
learned
during
the
coming
fateful
weeks
in
brussels
