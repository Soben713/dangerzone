the
great
emancipator
for
more
than
a
year
theu.s
has
been
urging
south
viet
nam
s
president
ngo
dinh
diem
todeclare
a
general
amnesty
for
communist
viet
cong
guerrillas
in
orderto
encourage
wholesale
desertions
from
the
red
cause
diem
was
infavor
of
the
idea
but
he
always
replied
that
as
abraham
lincolnwaited
two
years
after
the
beginning
of
the
civil
war
before
issuinghis
emancipation
proclamation
he
too
would
wait
for
a
propitiousmoment
so
that
the
move
could
not
be
interpreted
as
a
desperate
gestureby
a
sinking
government
to
round
up
popular
support
last
week
confident
that
the
war
against
the
reds
had
taken
a
turn
for
thebetter
diem
finally
proclaimed
an
open
arms
clemency
program
.diem
s
declaration
was
speeded
by
the
encouraging
results
of
aninformal
government
clemency
program
in
effect
since
february
that
hascaused
the
defection
of
more
than
2
700
viet
cong
followers
includingseveral
minor
red
officials
under
the
terms
of
the
new
proclamation
red
defectors
will
be
given
the
opportunity
to
reform
and
redeemthemselves
by
deeds
and
depending
on
these
deeds
will
be
entitled
tolighter
sentences
or
be
absolved
of
past
offenses
but
the
offer
ofamnesty
applies
only
to
viet
cong
sympathizers
and
not
to
hard
corecommunist
cadres
who
diem
feels
are
incapable
of
rehabilitation
.diem
s
announcement
came
on
the
first
anniversary
of
the
start
of
