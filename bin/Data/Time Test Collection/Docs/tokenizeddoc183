chancellor

who
hates
to

after

years
inpower
and
hates
even
more
to
give
way
to
erhard
thought
he
couldstall
off
erhard
s
formal
appointment
at
a
party
meeting
last

tried
to
talk
about
everything
but
his

declared
that
he
could
not
tolerate
a
chancellor
designate
looking
over
my
shoulder
in
the
remaining
months
before
his
promisedfall
retirement
is
a
fact
besides
he
added
i
simply
don
t
see
whywe
must
reach
a
decision
now
since

he
snapped
how
do

i
felt
inside

i
would
rather

when
the
c.d.u

the

was
still
burning
i
bear
no
personal
animosity

he
said
but
my
opinion
is
that
he
is
not
asuitable

overwhelmingly
disagreed

sweet
for

against
his
old
foe
he
pledged
to
forgive

then
swung
to

he
told

to
pass
along
to
you
all
