while
tshombe
guffawed
as
a
final
act
ofobstreperousness
he
had
peacemaker

thrown
out
of

as
foreign
minister
evariste
kimba
complained
you
have
donenothing
for

but
tshombe
was
beaten
nonetheless
even
his

sir

prime
minister
of

rhodesias
and
nyasaland
told
him
he
had
acted
wisely
in

is
everybody
happy
the
central

promised
moise
a
general
and
complete
amnesty
for

and
his
followers
with
that
tshombe
returned
toelisabethville
to
work
out
the
procedures
of
his
capitulation
with

he
found
that
some

the
question

was
whetherleopoldville

nowthat
it
was

if
the

600
students
