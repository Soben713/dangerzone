said
dr

professor
of

medicine
at

in
a
recent
bbc
lecture
it
is
littered
with
the
debrisof
broken
convictions
a
new
concept
is
emerging
of
sexualrelationships
as
a
source
of
pleasure
but
also
as
a
mutualencountering
of
personalities
in
which
each
explores
the
other
and
atthe

time
discovers
new
depths
in
himself
or

in

controversial
report
a
group
of
the
religious
society
offriends
attacked
the
onus
attached
to
a
great
increase
in
adolescentsexual
intimacy
and
premarital
affairs
it
is
fairly
common
inboth
young
men
and
women
with
high
standards
of
conduct
and
integrityto
have
one
or
two
love
affairs

the

said
the
report
this
concluded
the
quaker
report
is
not
such
a
sin
where
there
isgenuine
tenderness
an
openness
to
responsibility
and
the
seed
ofcommitment
god
is
surely
not
shut
out
a
blessing
all
the
hubbubover
sex
has
to
be
sure
caused
a
lot
of
misgivings
and
few
churchmenshare
the
quakers
liberal
view
but
most
experts
agree
with
writer
v.
s
pritchett
that
allowing
for
its
crudities
the
sexualrevolution
has
been
one
of
the
few
blessings
in
the
life
of
thiscentury
they
attribute
the
new
sexual
tolerance
and
the
lesseningof
victorian
shame
to
a
wide
variety
of
combined
causes
the
heavyimpact
of
both
world
wars
on
the
old
morality
the
emancipation
ofwomen
from
the
hearth
a
gradual
increase
in
coeducational
schooling
and
even
the
fact
that
more
britons
travel
abroad
for
holidays
butexactly
where
the
present
orgy
of
introspection
will
lead
not
even
theexperts
can
predict
what
seems
certain
however
is
that
the

of

no

than

he
