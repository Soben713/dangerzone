handed
almost
equalcabinet

to
the
two

mboya
was
named

he
will
have

worked
outlast
year
in
london
britain
was
to
retain
control
of
defense
foreignaffairs
and
internal
security
but
last
week
presumably
impressed
bykenyatta
s
moderate
words
britain
s
macdonald
disclosed
that
all
threewould
be
transferred
to
the
new
government
and
complete
independencemay
well
be
won
by
the
first
of
the
year
a
high
british
official
innairobi
expressed
guarded
optimism
it
s
much
more
promising
than
iexpected
more
and
more
european
settlers
have
decided
to
remain
inkenya
and
i
think
their
view
is
justified
of
course
tribalism
couldmuck
it
all
up
but
with
a
little
luck
i
think
kenya
can
graduallycrawl
forward
