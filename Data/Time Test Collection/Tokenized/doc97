when
as

i
felt

i
figured
it
was

but
the
game
went
on
after

excused
himself
then
ilooked
down
and
there
was
this
huge
rat
trying
to
pry
some
meat
outfrom
under
my
foot

i
knew
we
had
rats

a

was
assured
by
the

of
a

that
he
couldn

possibly
have

joined

mostly
used

bugged

with

so
as
to
detectenemy
strongholds
they
also
planted
extrastrong
traps
that
arenormally
used
to

ginza
rats
are
a
special
samurai
breedthat
can
usually
chew

the
hunters
had
noillusions
about
their
foe
the
ginza
rats
are
terribly
clever
said
one
old
rodent
fighter
you
can
t
just
leave
a
meatball
by
arathole
and
expect
them
to
eat
its
much
too
obvious
what
you
must
dois
put
the
meatballs
in
say
a
cardboard
box
with
a
little
hole
in
it.
then
the
rat
will
eat
it
thinking
it
s
something
you
don
t
want
himto
have
in
three
days
the
exterminators
had
killed
about
6
500rats
outright
and
expected
another
3
000
to
die
later
as
the
poisontook
effect
but
each
female
rat
can
theoretically
produce
about
70offspring
