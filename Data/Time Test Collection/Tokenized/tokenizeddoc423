cambodia
the
slumbering
prince
former
u.s
secretary
of
statedean
acheson
is
one
of
the
most
highly
esteemed
americans
inpnom
penh
the
reason
dates
back
to
last
year
when
achesonsuccessfullyrepresented
cambodia
before
the
international
court
of
justice
in
thehague
in
a
territorial
dispute
with
thailand
last
week
the
u.s
.tried
to
capitalize
on
this
friendship
in
an
effort
to
end
its
acerbicand
somewhat
mysterious
little
quarrel
with
cambodia
s
vain
unpredictable
leader
prince
norodom
sihanouk
the
u.s
was
rudelyrebuffed
sending
acheson
out
to
cambodia
on
a
peacemaking
missionwould
be
fine
declared
the
prince
but
only
on
three
conditions
1
that
washington
apologize
for
the
u.s
diplomat
who
described
as
barbarous
radio
cambodia
s
tasteless
comments
on
john
f
kennedy
sassassination
2
a
formal
withdrawal
by
u.s
diplomats
of
a
questionasking
whether
the
cambodian
government
had
rejoiced
over
kennedy
sdeath
3
and
the
closing
down
of
a
radio
station
that
sihanoukclaimed
was
run
by
cia
in
laos
or
thailand
for
the
purpose
of
sendingsubversive
broadcasts
into
cambodia
washington
termed
sihanouk
sconditions
totally
unacceptable
in
fact
sihanouk
is
probablyonly
taunting
the
u.s
out
of
fear
of
the
red
chinese
and
wants
toavoid
an
overt
diplomatic
break
sihanouk
is
still
anxious
for
ageneva
conference
to
guarantee
cambodian
neutrality
but
such
aconference
is
meaningless
without
u.s
participation
as
sihanoukhimself
said
last
week
after
closing
cambodia
s
embassy
in
london
itappears
necessary
without
a
diplomatic
break
to
put
our
relations
inslumber
