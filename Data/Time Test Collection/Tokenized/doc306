at
times

more
than

said
nikita
khrushchev
in
moscow
love
and
respectfor
other
people
is
what
we
need
the
love
feast
lasted
all
week
.the
beaming
smile
splashing
across
khrushchev
s
moonface
the
blunt
back
slapping
peasant
humor
the
friendly
bear
quality
of
the
sovietboss
when
he
decides
to
be
amiable
all
these
familiar
traits
were
onfull
display
in
moscow
as
u.s.
british
and
russian
diplomats
sat
downto
try
to
negotiate
a
nuclear
test
ban
agreement
with
painfulmemories
of
the
shortlived
spirit
of
geneva
in
1955
and
theevanescent
spirit
of
camp

in
1959
u.s
officials
refuse
toregard
khrushchev
s
joviality
as
a
true
barometer
of

yet
from
the
atmosphere
around
the
conference
table
therewas
evidence
that
a
new
and
possibly
somewhat
more
durable
spirit
ofmoscow
was
in

with

backward

we
begin
immediately
with
the

added
gromyko
then
all
that
will
remain
will
be
to
fill
thetreaty
in
during
the
early
sessions
it
almost
seemed
that
easy
.khrushchev
said
that
since
it
had
been
impossible
to
reach
agreementon
a
full
ban
in
the
past
the
time
had
come
to
achieve
more
byattempting
less
he
gave
soviet
approval
to
a
limited
ban
which
wouldcover
all
tests
except
those
underground
repeating
his
familiaropposition
to
onsite
inspections
of
possible
underground
blasts
asusual
gromyko
argued
that
such
inspections
were
unnecessary
anyway
inview
of

devices
when
the
sudden

accidentally

fromearthquakes
the
u.s
is
nevertheless
willing
to
defer
the
question
.as
for
khrushchev
he
was
in
a
selling
mood
drawing
out
of
the
hat
afive
year
old
soviet
proposal
he
called
for
the
establishment
ofinspection
posts
at
airfields
highways
railroad
stations
and
ports
onboth
sides
of
the
iron
curtain
to
reduce
the
possibility
of

he
also
proposed
1
freezing
or
reduction
of
military
budgets
2
a
reduction
of
the
armed
forces
on
both
sides
in
east
and
westgermany
and
3
a
nonaggression
pact
between
the
nato
and

he
even
seemed
willing
to
accept
the
u.s
idea
of

separate

instead
of
a

the

that
any

than

would

usher

would

.why
after

pushing

khrushchev
presumably
wantsa

to
demonstrate

thefeasibility
of

coexistence
nor
would
khrushchev
mindcutting
down
a
little
on
the
prohibitive
cost
of
nuclear
testing
andproduction
which
impedes
his
oft
stated
desire
to
raise
livingstandards
in
the
soviet
union
lastly
while
a
test
ban
would
not
bebinding
on
either
france
or

china
it
would
place
the
onus
ofdefying

that
in

get

something
more
than

from
