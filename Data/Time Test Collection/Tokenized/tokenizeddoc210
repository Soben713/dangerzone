isnasserism
a
crime
in

now
if
it
is
how
can
we
face
the
futuretogether
if
there
are
in
damascus
people
who
consider
nasserism
acrime
then
how
do
you
expect
me
to
cooperate
with
them
what
setoff
amer
s
flood
of
rhetorical
questions
was
the
threat
posed
tonasser
s
dream
of
arab
unity
by
the
gyrations
of
syria
s
baath
partyleaders
headed
by
tall
lugubrious
premier
salah
bitar
the
baathleadership
wants
arab
unity
as
much
as
does
nasser
but
it
has
refusedto
let
the
party
be
drowned
in
an
allencompassing
nasserite
nationalfront
the
conflict
became
acute
last
month
when
the
regime
beganpurging
the
syrian
army
of
pro
nasser
officers
and
noncoms
inretaliation
six
nasserite
cabinet
ministers
resigned
while
studentsstaged
sitins
in
the
schools
pro
nasser
mobs
poured
into
the
streetsof
damascus
and
aleppo
where
scores
of
demonstrators
were
killed
orwounded
battling
soldiers
and
police
as
the
violence
in
the
streetsgrew
worse
the
baath
leaders
faced
the
prospect
of
destroying
arabunity
and
lowering
the
prestige
of
their
party
last
week
harassed
mournful
premier
bitar
finally
gave
in
and
resigned
to
be
replaced
by

candidate
dr

a
dentist
from
hama
who
waspreviously
minister
of
guidance
and
culture
there
was
somepossibility
that
the
new
premier
might
be
acceptable
to
both
sides
to
the
baathists
because
jundi
was
once
a
party
member
and
had
stood
bythe
government
to
the
nasserites
because
he
has
been
a
longtimeadmirer
of
egypt
s
strongman
and
believes
in
unity
at
all
costs
atweek
s
end
the
regime
in

iraq
was
also
giving
ground
tothe
nasserites
the
entire

cabinet
resigned
but
lean
balding
premier
hassan
bakr
was
commissioned
to
form
a
new

presumably
one
with
