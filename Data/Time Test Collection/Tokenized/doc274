the
fact
that
valya
was
not
a
pilot
andadmittedly
was
mechanically
unsophisticated
raised
the
question
of
whyu.s
astronauts
all
must
be
skilled
test
pilots
the
answer
from
nasaofficials
use
of
test
pilots
permits
the
elimination
ofspace
consuming
automatic
equipment
in
the
cramped
capsules
but
someauthorities
are
convinced
that
young
scientists
would
be
far
moreeffective
in
observing
and
analyzing
unexpected
