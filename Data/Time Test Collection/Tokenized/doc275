what

statement
declared
if

cannotuse
its

to

instead
is
a
party
that

hither

in

such

those

how
can
the

agree
they
cannot
it
is
impossible
as
always
peking
stuck
to
the
dogma
that
the
road
to
violent
revolution
inafrica
asia
and
latin

was
the
only
path
a
true

therussians

too
selfish
and

that

peking
s
punch
wasneatly
timed
to
catch
the

off

it
landed
on
the
eve
ofa
special
central

meeting
called
to
discuss
russia
s

troubles
for
four
days
the
russians
were
stunned
andspeechless
finally
the
central

angrily
announced
that
itwould
not
