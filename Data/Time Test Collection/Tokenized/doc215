along

emotionally
a
retired
greek
general
announced
that
hewas
personally
ready
to
slash
his

arrived
promptly
at
noon
in
his
blue
andwhite
caravelle
jetairliner
inspected
an
honor
guard
as

smoke
from

drifted
into

then
climbed
into
a

with
greece

tall
king

as
the

reached

jumped
to
his
feet
waved
theatrically
to
theathenians
gathered
under
the
pepper
trees
at

arch
near
thetemple
of

he
said
with
feeling
no
frenchman
especially
myself
could
fail
to
be
moved
by
this
city
nor
forget
whathas
been
accomplished
here
for

in

years
then
heplunged
nearsightedly
into
the
curbside
crowd
to
shake

aprocedure
that
gives

guards
perpetual
jitters
but
thechance
of
a
potshot
at
de
gaulle
was
not
the
only
worry
of
greekleaders
the
government
was
also
uneasy
that
de
gaulle
might
try
toembroil
greece
in
his
quarrel
with
britain
over
the
common
market
andwith
the
u.s
over
nato
defense
it
was
france
not
greece
which
hadpushed
the
trip
de
gaulle
had
picked
up
an
invitation
made
sevenyears
before
to
then
president
rene
coty
paris
also
suggested
thatthe
french
fleet
drop
anchor
in
the
piraeus
to
coincide
with
degaulle
s
arrival
and
discreetly
broached
the
plan
of
having
de
gaulleaddress
the
greek
public
as
he
had
done
with
such
success
during
hisgerman
tour
last
year
when
greek
reaction
to
both
ideas
was
cool
they
were
abandoned
the
hinge
nevertheless
greece
was
in
a
mood
tobe
wooed
by
le
grand
charles
athens
officials
were
shocked
lastsummer
when
the
20
million
annual
u.s
defense
and
economic
aid
wasabruptly
cut
off
on
the
theory
that
the
greek
economy
no
longer
neededit
de
gaulle
is
said
to
be
prepared
to
climax
his
visit
with
an
offerof
a

ata
palace
banquet
de
gaulle
made
clear
in
a
toast
to
king
paul
that
hehopes
to
extend
france
s
influence
from
the
northern
seas
which
hecalled
one
of
france
s
boundaries
to
the
eastern
mediterranean
where
he
pointed
out
greece
is
the
hinge
between
the
latin
and
slavicworlds
as
well
as
between
western
europe
and
the
middle
east
thesewords
and
de
gaulle
s
wooing
manner
set
diplomats
everywhere
to
afresh
study
of
his
upcoming
ambitious
