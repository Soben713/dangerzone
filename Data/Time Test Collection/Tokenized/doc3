but
hans
weidner
did
have
one
major
asset
the
bus
thathe
operated
for
the
local
communist
regime
it
was
an
ugly
thing
andancient
its
chassis
creaked
and
the
engine
coughed
acream
colored
coat
of
paint
could
not
disguise
the
welts
and
bruises
oftwo
decades
of
chugging
service
in
fact
the
bus
was
ready
for
thejunk
pile
when
weidner
decided
to
press
it
into
service
for
one
lastrun
sharp
blades
the
hazards
would
be
great
on
the
journey
to

so
weidner
signed
up

wagnerattached
a
heavy
snowplow
to
the

of

but
to

heavy
obstacles

them
atroadblocks

all
six
lugs
on
each
front
wheel
they
boltedsharp
blades
of
the
toughest
steel
affixed
so
that
the
whirling
edgeswould
chop
barbed
wire
to
bits
then
they
wedged

of

inside
the
