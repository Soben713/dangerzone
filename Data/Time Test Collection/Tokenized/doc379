great
britain
into
battle
i
m
looking
forward
to
this
fight
said
sir
alec
douglas
home
last
week
i
m
almost
spoiling
for
it
he
did
not
have
long
to
spoil
next
day
as
parliament
reassembled
shouting
leaping
tory
backbenchers
cheered
lustily
while
the
newlyelected
member
for
kinross
took
his
oath
as
an
m.p
and
moved
into
hisplace
for
the
first
time
on
the
government
s
front
bench
pulling
outa
small
red
and
gold
ballpoint
pen
douglas
home
hunched
down
in
hisseat
and
scribbled
furiously
on
slips
of
paper
for
the
next
42
minuteswhile
labor
party
leader
harold
wilson
delivered
a
cutting
attack
onthe
government
like
a
poster
claiming
that
the
tories
modernization
plans
for
new
roads
schools
and
housing
were
borrowedfrom
labor
wilson
said
tartly
imitation
is
the
sincerest
form
ofpolitical
desperation
why
he
continued
have
we
heard
so
littleabout
modernization
in
the
past
twelve
years
i
never
undervalue
thepower
of
repentance
but
it
has
taken
a
very
long
time
amid
criesof
approval
and
derision
from
both
sides
of
the
packed
house
the
primeminister
rose
nervously
shuffled
his
notes
and
placed
them
neatly
onthe
dispatch
box
in
front
of
him
it
s
been
twelve
years
since
ilast
spoke
in
this
house
he
began.
in
the
next
few
minutes
itbecame
all
too
plain
that
the
cozier
clubbish
style
of
the
house
oflords
had
blunted
douglas
home
s
debating
thrust
and
his
supportersmissed
his
usual
pungent
wit
after
a
long
meandering
preamble
helaunched
into
a
lackluster
exposition
of
ambitious
government
policiesfor
the
coming
year
the
formula
said
he
flatly
is
growthwithout
inflation
and
the
method
acceleration
from
positionspreviously
prepared
groaned
one
conservative
god
it
s
like
atory
election
poster
twice
sir
alec
even
made
the
tactical
gaffeof
referring
to
wilson
as
possible
later
prime
minister
the
torybenches
remained
deathly
silent
while
labor
s
triumphant
roar
surgedaround
the
slight
pale
prime
minister
firmer
ground
he
went
onmanfully
but
again
and
again
labor
s
uproarious
barracking
silencedhim
for
painful
seconds
at
a
time
he
waded
through
the
unfamiliarmarshes
of
economics
finally
reached
firmer
ground
when
he
turned
toforeign
policy
staring
coldly
at
wilson
who
wants
to
abandonbritain
s
independent
deterrent
sir
alec
declared
that
he
intends
tomake
this
a
central
issue
of
the
campaign
once
britain
renouncesnuclear
arms
he
warned
we
could
never
go
back
into
this
business
.the
government
means
to
retain
nuclear
forces
under
our
own
control
adding
that
without
them
we
would
no
longer
have
a
place
at
the
peacetable
as
of
right
the
cuban
crisis
he
said
forced
russia
to
modify
its
tactics
but
the
communist
aim
is
clearly
stillunchanged
it
is
to
destroy
our
way
of
life
in
cold
type
next
day
his
speech
read
creditably
enough
but
on
both
sides
of
the
housethere
was
agreement
that
the
prime
minister
s
eagerly
awaited
commonsdebut
had
been
a
disappointing
performance
.he
sat
in
the
commons
from
1931
to
1945
as
m.p.
for
south
lanark
was
re
elected
in
1950
but
went
to
the
lords
aftersucceeding
to
the
14th
earldom
of
home
in
1951
