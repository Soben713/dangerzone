off
only
six
weeks
ago
most
british
politiciansbelieved
that
prime
minister
harold
macmillan
s
government
would
notdare
call
a
general
election
before
spring
1964
but
in
westminsterlast

m.p.s
were

that
the
tories
would
go

about
the

possible
thursday
britain
s
traditional

before

of

reason
for
the
shift
inthinking
was
the
good
economic
news
for
the
government
that
came
withspring

after
the
worst
winter
of

suddenly
cameword

most
welcome
news
of
all
last

was
that

figure

thetories
still
faced
a
long
hazardous
haul
politically
andeconomically
the
biggest
roadblock
is
that
industry
will
not
be
ableto
expand
and
compete
in

markets
without

pockets
in

many
tory
m.p.snow
fear
that
if
the
government
waits
until
next
year
before
callingthe
election
it
may
lose
its
gains
in

in

case
the

is
already
under
way
primeminister
harold
macmillan
threw
a
straw
in
the
wind
by
reappointinghardheaded
lord
poole
as
cochairman
of
the
party
with
leader
of
thehouse
iain
macleod
poole
who
raised
record
sums
for
the
tories
inthe
1955
and
1959
campaigns
is
the
reputed
author
of
the
never
had
it
so
good
theme
that
helped
return
the
government
at
thelast
election
grey
utopia
last
weekend
with
poole
and
32
other
toptories
who
were
summoned
to
the
prime
minister
s
country
home
macmillan
started
drafting
the
party
s
broad
long
term
program
ofsocial
and
economic
reform
its
theme
said
macmillan
will
be
modernize
not
nationalize
in
his
fiercest
attack
on
labor
in
manymonths
the
prime
minister
charged
in
a
speech
to
glasgow
tories
that
the
socialists
have
nothing
to
offer
except
old
threats
supported
bysly
promises
the
opposition
declared
macmillan
still
clings
toits
old
hat
view
of
a
socialist
utopia
in
which
everybody
ismore
or
less
the
same
shade
of
grey
he
insisted
that
under
labor
britain
would
revert
swiftly
to
the
status
of
a
secondclass
power
macmillan
s
final
decision
on
the
election
date
will
be
influenced
bythe
gallup
poll
percentages
which
in
april
showed
a
fractional
slip
inlabor
s
massive
lead
now
49.5
per
cent
to
34
per
cent
over
thetories
other
omens
will
be
the
results
of
three
spring
by

by
the
deaths
of
hugh
gaitskell
and
two
other
labor
m.p.s.
one
thing
was
certain
at
69
harold
macmillan
is
still
confidentthat
the
party
cannot
yet
dispense
with
his
leadership
by
way
ofpatching

he
has
already
quashed
