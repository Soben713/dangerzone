italiandemocracy
last
week
was
staggering
toward
a
political
crisis
that
maywell
prove
to
be
the
worst
since
the
communists
were
narrowly
defeated15
years
ago
on
the
verge
of
entering
the
government
was
a
marxistparty
that
at
its
worst
is
openly
allied
with
the
communists
and
atbest
is
only
a
lukewarm
and
neutrality
minded
adherent
of
the

.seeking
permission
when
the
original
apertura
a

opening
tothe
left
was
engineered
a
little
less
than
two
years
ago
it
happenedlargely
because
the
long
ruling
christian
democrats
felt
themselvesslipping
at
the
polls
and
generally
declining
in
vigor
compared
totheir
early
postwar
days
the
solution
advanced
by
left
wing
christiandemocrats
with
the
zealous
backing
of
washington
was
a
series
ofreforms
in
education
agriculture
and
taxation
all
involving
largemeasures
of
government
planning
since
this
program
was
opposed
by
therightist
parties
in
parliament
including
the
free
enterprisingliberals
the
christian
democrats
needed
support
elsewhere
to
be
ableto
form
a
majority
they
sought
it
from
pietro
nenni

according
to
the
apertura
agreement
the
nenni
socialistsdid
not
enter
the
government
but
supported
it
in
parliament

some
christian

the

would
bewooed
into
breaking
their
longstanding
alliance
