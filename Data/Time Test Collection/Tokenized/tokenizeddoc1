to
help

develop
its

no

last

as

studied

accord
between

kennedy
and
prime
minister
macmillan
europeans
saw
emerging
the
first
outlines
of
the
nuclear
nato
that
theu.s
wants
and
will
support
it
all
sprang
from
the
anglo
u.s
.crisis
over
cancellation
of
the
bug
ridden
skybolt
missile
and
theu.s
offer
to
supply
britain
and
france
with
the
proved
polaris
time
dec
28
the
one
allied
leader
who
unreservedly
welcomed
the
polarisoffer
was
harold
macmillan
who
by
thus
keeping
a
separate
nucleardeterrent
for
britain
had
saved
his
own
neck
back
from
nassau
theprime
minister
beamed
that
britain
now
had
a
weapon
that
will
last
ageneration
the
terms
are
very
good
many
other
britons
were
not
sosure
though
the
government
will
shoulder
none
of
the
800
milliondevelopment
cost
of
polaris
it
has
already
poured
28
million
intoskybolt
and
will
have
to
spend
perhaps
1
billion
more
for
a
fleet
ofmissile
packing
submarines
at
best
the
british
will
not
be
able
todesign
build
and
prove
its
nuclear
fleet
before
1970
three
yearsafter
britain
s
bomber
force
has
presumably
become
obsolete
then
what
tory
backbenchers
are
loudly
skeptical
of
what
they
call
thesmall
type
in
the
nassau
pact
which
stipulates
that
britain
spolaris
submarine
fleet
except
when
supreme
national
interests
intervene
must
be
committed
to
a
truly
multilateral
nato
force
doesthat
mean
that
britain
will
eventually
have
no
strike
force
of
its
own
who
will
decide
when
or
whether
national
interests
justifywithdrawal
of
submarines
from
nato
particularly
if
those
nationalinterests
conflict
with
u.s
policy
the
biggest
question
of
all
iswhether
france
s
inclusion
in
the
offer
was
a
deliberate
ploy
by
jackkennedy
to
end
or
at
least
downgrade
britain
s
prized
specialrelationship
with
the
u.s
the
cartoonists
went
even
farther
theynot
only
showed
supermac
jumping
to
superjack
s
commands
but
de
gaulleand
adenauer
as
well
as
edith
said
the
french
who
got
no
help
fromthe
u.s
in
developing
their
force
de
frappe
were
quick
to
crow
thatbritain
s
vaunted
ties
with
the
u.s
had
brought
it
nothing
buthumiliation
by
contrast
bragged
french
officials
the
skybolt
fiascoonly
vindicated
france
s
decision
to
develop
its
own
bombs
and
deliverysystems
thus
though
charles
de
gaulle
promised
to
reflect
on
thepolaris
offer
there
was
little
likelihood
that
he
would
accept
anyoffer
that
would
subject
a
french
force
to
allied
control
it
is
degaulle
s
unswerving
conviction
that
if
the
russians
were
actually
toinvade
western
europe
no
nation
that
was
not
directly
attacked
meaningthe
u.s
would
invite
nuclear
devastation
by
helping
its
allies
thusunlike
britain
s
bomber
force
which
all
along
has
been
pledged
to
the
western

france
s
force

beresponsible
only
for
france
s

at
the
same
time
de
gaulle
haslong
argued
that
the
atlantic
alliance
could
be
run
most
efficiently
bya
triumvirate
that
would
include
france
as
an
equal
of
the
u.s
andbritain
this
is
one
of
his
major
if
unspoken
conditions
for
britishmembership
in
the
common
market
and
de
gaulle
suggested
pointedly
tomacmillan
that
it
would
help
if
britain
were
to
share
its
advancedmissile
technology
with
france
when
macmillan
replied
noncommittallythat
he
would
have
to
discuss
this
with
kennedy
de

told

that

grandeur
konrad
adenauer
on
the

hand
is
fearful
that
de

will
snap
up

and
in
this
way
achieve
his
goal
of
a

though
his
government
vowed
in

not
to

last

anofficial

the

cry
that

forgreater

are
aimed
at

a

suggested
that
germany

almost
50
per

of

does
not

.fact
is
the
british

never

without

the
british

that

it
is
just
a

nuisance
said
a

last

it

that
we
will
be
expected
to

charles

until
