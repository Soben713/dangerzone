multi
bafflement
the
u.s
.today
is
engaged
in
not
one
but
two
nuclear
arms
races
its
first
andoverriding
concern
of
course
is
to
deter
soviet
aggression
and
to
becapable
of
massive
retaliation
if
the
russians
should
attack
the
west
.washington
s
second
aim
however
is
less
strategic
than
political
it
could
be
called
the
theory
of
the
massive
placebo
since
its
primarypurpose
is
not
to
deter
the
foes
of
the
u.s
but
to
mollify
itsfriends
and
discourage
the
proliferation
of
nuclear
arms
by
lastweek
u.s
placebo
planners
had
succeeded
only
in
frustrating
andperplexing
the
very
allies
they
hoped
to
please
uneasily
aware
thatthe
increasingly
prosperous
and
powerful
nations
of
western
europewould
not
forever
accept
total
u.s
control
of
nuclear
weapons
theu.s
offered
more
than
two
years
ago
to
give
them
a
voice
in
theirdisposition
and
use
but
left
it
to
europe
to
devise
a
formula
it
wasnot
until
the
kennedy
administration
canceled
the
bug
ridden
skyboltmissile
project
last
december
that
the
u.s
was
forced
to
take
theinitiative
in
place
of
skybolt
the
administration
reluctantlyoffered
at
nassau
to
supply
polaris
missiles
for
an
independent
britishsubmarine
force
change
of
mind
at
the
same
time
the
u.s
insistedthat
the
british
subs
must
be
multinational
that
is
they
were
tobe
part
of
a
nato
deterrent
in
which
other
allies
might
in
time
pooltheir
own
strike
forces
if
and
when
they
acquired
nuclear
weapons
toplacate
its
other
european
allies
the
kennedy
administration
alsoproposed
a
multilateral
force
of
polaris
submarines
which
would
bemultimanned
and
multifinanced
by
the
u.s
and
its
partners
each
ofwhom
would
have
a
veto
over
the
use
of
the
missiles
then
just
as
theeuropeans
began
to
get
interested
in
this
scheme
the
u.s
abruptlychanged
its
mind
and
announced
that
the
multilateral
force
mlf
shouldconsist
of
polaris
armed
surface
vessels
instead
though
it
would
belittle
strategic
value
a
25
ship
surface
force
would
cost
only
500million
yearly
far
less
than
a
submarine
fleet
to
most
europeans
the
strongest
argument
for
the
mlf
was
that
it
would
give
west
germanya
voice
in
nuclear
strategy
and
possibly
discourage
it
from
developingnuclear
weapons
of
its
own

or
without

warm
reception

hemmed
that
its

in

that

for

its
change
of
mind
not
onlyleft
unsolved
the
political
problems
that
mlf
was
devised
to
solve
buteven
seemed
likely
to
aggravate
them
since
the
u.s
was
nowreportedly
ready
to
back
the
idea
of
independent
multinational
forcesinstead
thus
encouraging
its
allies
to
build
their
own
bombs
even
ifevery
nato
ally
could
afford
its
own
nuclear
force
and
a

may
yet
make
that
feasible
europe
would
have
only

armory

who
can
predict
howit
will
turn
out
in
the
brave
new
world
