slipped
out
of
his

palace
inelisabethville
climbed
into
the
back
seat
of
a
black

andsped
off
down
the

toward
the
northern

soon
anarmored

of

was
on
his
tail
for

it
looked
as
if
the

in
hot
pursuit
of
its
old
foe
.but
no
to
the
astonishment
of

along

moisewas
actually
leading
the

urging
his
own
tatteredkatangese
gendarmes
to
lay
down
their
arms
so
the

could
reopenvital

bizarre
as
it
was
the
incident
was
anaccurate
indicator
of
the
way
things
actually
were
going
last
week
inthe
congo
s
copper
rich
katanga
province
where
the
u.n
was
wagingwar
with
tshombe
s
breakaway
regime
for
the
third
time
since
september1961
in
two
weeks
the
tough
u.n
troops
had
seized
a
steadilylengthening
ribbon
of
rail
lines
and
nearly
every

only
for

might
not

with
full
backing
from

theu.n
was
determined
to
dictate

make
it

the

starved
of
the
riches
that
enablekatanga

account
for
65

the
big

asusual
was
the
slippery
tshombe
as
the
week
began
he
was
holed
updefiantly
in
kolwezi
with
the
mercenaries
there
were
rumors
that
hemight
flee
to

rather
than
give
in
to
the

he
was
notsurrendering
