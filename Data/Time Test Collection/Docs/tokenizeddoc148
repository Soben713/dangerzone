from

the
little
coldeyed
man
who

might
have
been

the

even
in

party
sixmonths
ago
pipe
puffing
harold
wilson
was
regarded
as
a
slipperyopportunist
and
a
constant
threat
to
the
party
s
hardwon
unity
underthe
late
hugh
gaitskell
though
his
views
on
most
major
issues
werecalculatedly
murky
little
harold
as
his
foes
call
him
drewleft
wing
support
by
condemning
u.s
handling
of
cuba
cheering
on
theunilateralists
bitterly
opposing
britain
s
bid
for
common
marketmembership
however
it
was
not
wilson
s
past
that
brought
outwashington
s
red
carpet
but
his
potential
future
even
thoughelections
will
probably
not
be
called
for
at

a

no

over

ifthat
trend
should
continue
harold

would
be
britain
s
next
primeminister
what
administration
officials
got
last
week
was
ampledemonstration
of
the
fact
that
since
gaitskell
s
death
the
flinty
quick
wittedyorkshireman
has
had
tomove
closer
to
the
political
center
to
hold
the
party
together
and
takehard
and
fast
stands
on
which
britain
s
electorate
can
weigh
the
meritsof
a
labor
government
wilson
was
plainly
anxious
to
win
the
newfrontier
s
confidence
after
an
intensive
four
day
round
ofconferences
with
president
kennedy
and
key
administrative
hands
thelabor
leader
s
views
on
most
outstanding
world
issues
seemed
now
atleast
as
close
to
u.s
policy
as
harold
macmillan
s
denegotiation.
wilson
s
most
reassuring
message
was
that
he
unequivocally
supportsnato
as
the
center
of
our
defense
policy
in
europe
to
the
delightof
the
defense
department
which
has
long
tried
in
vain
to
persuadebritain
to
build
up
its
chronically
inadequate
ground
forces
on
thecontinent
wilson
argued
that
britain
could
well
afford
a
strong
armyif
as
he
proposes
it
were
to
eliminate
its
nuclear
strike
force
thesocalled
independent
so
called
british
socalled
deterrent
thus
if
elected
wilson
would
denegotiate
britain
s
agreement
at
nassauto
build
a
polaris
submarine
fleet
and
hope
thereby
to
discourageother
nations
from
building
independent
deterrents
he
is
stronglyopposed
to
giving
germany
a
finger
on
the
trigger
which
would
behighly
provocative
to
the
soviet
union
and
make
it
even
harder
to
getagreements
particularly
on
the
matter
of
disarmament
belyingreports
that
he
was
soft
on
west
berlin
wilson
insisted
that
itmust
remain
a
free
and
viable
city
and
that
allied
troops
would
haveto
be
stationed
there
for
the
foreseeable
future
reservations
.there
were
some
issues
on
which
wilson
s
views
were
directly
at
oddswith
those
of
the
administration
u.s
officials
were
inclined
toshrug
them
off
as
lip
service
to
labor
s
left
wing
most
importantdivergence
is
his
support
for
withdrawal
of
nato
and
soviet
troops
fromcentral
europe
making
nuclear
free
zones
of
east
and
west
germanyand
hungary
a
proposal
that
the
u.s
considers
impractical
anddangerous
wilson
seemed
as
wobbly
as
ever
on
some
questions
notablythe
common
market
which
he
now
conditionally
favors
he
supportsgreater
east
west
trade
which
is
not
an
administration
goal
andfavors
seating
communist
china
in
the
u.n.
which
is
directly
contraryto
u.s
policy
but
he
told
u.s
officials
that
these
are
nothigh
priority
aims
these
views
gave
reason
for
continued
reservationsabout
harold
wilson
moreover
though
his
incisive
pragmatic
styleundeniably
impressed
washington
older
heads
have
still
to
be
persuadedthat
wilson
s
convictions
will
not
shift
again
as
they
have
so
manytimes
before
