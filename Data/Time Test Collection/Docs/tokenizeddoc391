it
was
the
first
step
in
prime
minister
hendrik
verwoerd
s
plan
to
solve
south
africa
s
race
problem
the
formation
of
black
self
governing
regions
called
bantustans
where
all
of
south
africa
s11
million
natives
except
for
a
few
million
needed
as
labor
for

are
to
be
herded
into
remote
and
undeveloped
reservations
.transkei
where
the
first
bantustan
legislature
was
being
drawn
is
adenmark

plot
of
rolling
land
along
the

whichfor

has
been
largely
ignored
by

whites
it
is
farm

thatthrough

overpopulation
has
been
victim
of
overgrazing
and
erosion.
without
