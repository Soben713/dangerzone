occasional
excesses
were
tolerated
by

they
made
it
appear
as
if

s
mostaudacious
gesture
of

was
to
give
the

his
autobiography
for
publication
knowing
well
that

is
permitted
to
publish
abroad
without

gettingclearance
from

for
offenses
ranging
from
bad
rhymes
to
sacrilgeious
statements
about
the

though
evtushenko
madeabject
apologies
for
his
irrevocable
mistake
the
drumfire
ofcriticism
only
grew

in

that
