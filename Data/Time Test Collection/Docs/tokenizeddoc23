asde
gaulle
prepared
to
stage
another
of
his
rare
press
performances
thisweek
political
dopesters
were
betting
he
would
use
the
occasion
togive
a
haughty
and
ringing
non

concessions
for
britain
s
entry
intothe

france
cannot
in
the
future
renounce
its
effort
andabandon
its
project
merely
because
washington
decides
to
present
someproposals
we
cannot
accept
polaris
missiles
and
at
the
same
time
pursue
our
national
effort
therefore
we
will
follow
our
nationaleffort
we
have
the
a
bomb
we
will
have
the
h
bomb
and
eventually
we
will
have
three

continued
the
american
interest
is
not
always
the
french
interest
.circumstances
change
interests
can
diverge
this
will
be
more
andmore
true
in
the
future
which
will
give
europe
a
greater
and
greaterweight
and
which
will
therefore
contribute
to
diminishing
the
relativeweight
of
the
u.s
