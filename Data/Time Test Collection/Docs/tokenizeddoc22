almost
a
year

toform
italy

apertura
a

opening

theuneasy

has
been
clouded
by
a
single
issue
nenni
s
demandfor
the
creation
of
15
regional
administrations
that
he
figures
willboost
his
party
s
grass
roots
support
fanfani
agreed
to
pay
nenni
sprice
because
he
needed
the
socialists
88
votes
in
the
chamber
ofdeputies
in
order
to
stay
in
power
but
he
stalled
on
enacting
thescheme
just
the
same
fanfani
feared
that
the
socialists
would
signlocal
electoral
agreements
with
communists
and
thereby
convert
the
newregions
into
leftist
strongholds
even
after
nenni
pledged
not
tocooperate
with
the
reds
many
of
fanfani
s
christian
democrats
remainedskeptical
of
his
promise
with
nenni
demanding
quick
action
on
theregional
plan
the
looming
alternative
was
compromise
or
collapse
ofthe
coalition
last
week
fanfani
acted
after
nine
hours
of
argument
christian
democrats
and
their
two
smaller
coalition
partners
agreed
tointroduce
promptly
two
bills
covering
taxation
and
administration
ofthe
regions
they
postponed
legislation
actually
creating

convenes
after

elections
in
may
thesocialists
grumbled
bitterly
but
nenni
urged
them
to
bide
their
time
if
there
s
going
to
be
a
government
crisis
he
told

nenni
has
his
eye
on
a
cabinet
post
in
a
new
government
causing
acrisis
at
the
moment
would
be
irresponsible
for
