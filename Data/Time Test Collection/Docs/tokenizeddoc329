nikita
khrushchev
last
week
traveled
to
marshal
tito
s
wonderlandin
yugoslavia
from
a
state
dinner
at
belgrade
s
white
palace
khrushchev
went
on
an
adriatic
cruise
aboard
tito
s
yacht
galeb
seagull
spent
three
days
at
tito
s
island
retreat
of
brioni
then
totito
s
400
year
old
castle
in
the
dinaric
alps
next
to
tito
s
summerresidence
at
brda
and
finally
to
tito
s
croatian
hunting
lodge
atbelje
to
the
chinese
who
have
long
complained
that
khrushchev
hasgone
over
to
the
enemy
camp
both
ideologically
and
in
his
personaltastes
all
this
must
have
seemed
infuriating
particularly
since
hosttito
is
their
ideological
archenemy
the
revisionist
who
firstbroke
with
stalin
and
established
a
more
or
less
independent
brand
ofmarxism
at
the
height
of
his
quarrel
with
peking
and
with
a
certainunrest
among
the
soviet
satellites
khrushchev
was
clearly
drawingcloser
to
tito
even
hinted
that
yugoslavia
might
be
allowed
toparticipate
in
comecon
the
creaky
eastern
common
market
tito
in
turnseemed
determined
to
suggest
that
even
if
moscow
accepts
himwholeheartedly
as
a
comrade
he
retain
his
independence
in
doing
sohe
presumably
had
an
eye
on
washington
where
congress
this
weekconsiders
whether
to
restore
the
previously
canceledmost
favored
nationrating
for
yugoslav
exports
to
the
u.s
cracked
a
yugoslav
official
we
didn
t
sign
a
treaty
with
khrushchev
as
you
americans
did
wedidn
t
even

the
twoleaders
did
just
about
everything
else
as
they
ranged
the
country
fromquake

to

montenegro
where
after
a
picnic

broke
into

a
fiery
footstamping
circle
dance
.khrushchev
and
his
stolid
wife
nina
and
tito
and
his
statuesque
spousejovanka
broke
into
the
ring
locking
arms
and
swirling
around
with
thepretty
girls
and
peasants
the
most
instructive
part
of
the
visit
cameat
the
rakovica
auto
plant
outside
belgrade
in
a
discussion
with
theworkers
khrushchev
seemed
fascinated
by
the
yugoslav
factory
system
ofdecentralized
locally
administered
socialism
through
workers
councilselected
by
the
employees
and
empowered
to
fire
or
reverse
the
decisionsof
the
plant
manager
the
system
has
long
been
denounced
by
redchinese
ideologues
and
by
russia
since
yugoslavia
was
kicked
out
ofthe
comintern
in
1948
even
khrushchev
once
sneered
the
workers
councils
are
only
good
when
they
are
propped
up
by
american
grain
andmeat
reversing
himself
khrushchev
called
the
councils
a
progressive
development
and
said
russia
was
facing
the
question
of
whether
or
not
conditions
are
ripe
for
the
democratization
ofmanagement
unless
there
is
a
force
of
public
opinion
our
managerstend
to
become
autocrats
of
course
your
system
may
not
be
totally
inline
with
the
leninist
principle
of
unified
leadership
don
t
you
everhave
trouble
between
workers
and
directors
assured
thatdisagreements
were
always
worked
out
khrushchev
shook
his
headskeptically
and
said
you
re
a
little
boastful
but
of
course
mamaalways
says
her
children
are
the
most
beautiful
you
ve
got
yourshortcomings
but
then
so
do
we
plaster
bust
warming
up
khrushchev
demanded
what
is
the
most
important
problem
now
itis
to
beat
capitalism
the
one
who
creates
the
most
through
massproduction
will
win
henry
ford
has
shown
us
how
to
do
it
headded
after
the
revolution
we
sent
a
delegation
to
henry
ford
andasked
him
to
help
us
build
a
factory
that
would
produce
30
000
cars
ayear
ford
told
us
that
a
factory
making
only
30
000
would
not
work
.the
car
would
be
too
expensive
he
said
we
should
come
back
when
wewere
ready
to
produce
120
000
a
year
to
illustrate
the
lessons
ofproductivity
khrushchev
even
rambled
off
into
biblical
history
inaccurately
recalling
that
christ
had
fed
40
000
persons
with
a
singleloaf
of
bread
with
his
usual
heavy
footed
humor
he
added
but
noone
knows
if
all
got
enough
to
eat
if
they
had
they
would
not
haveleft
palestine
as
for
the
chinese
they
say
that
their
countryhas
to
rely
on
its
own
resources
it
is
true
and
it
is
not
true
ifyou
lock
yourself
within
your
own
frontiers
you
lose
your
economicpotential
they
say
they
are
going
to
rely
on
their
own
resources
andthen
they
write
to
us
for
credits
the
entranced
workers
at
rakovicaresponded
to
all
this
by
handing
khrushchev
a
present
he
must
have
longwanted
and
needed
a
plaster
bust
of
lenin
presumably
none
of
henryford
was
available
