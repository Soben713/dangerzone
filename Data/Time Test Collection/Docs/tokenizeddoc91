is
believed
to
have
ordered
the
attempted
assassination
of
de
gaulle
atpetit
clamart
outside
paris
last
year
soon
after
the
paris
pressheadlined
the
story
of
the
arrest
l
affaire
argoud
was
turned
into
afirst
rate
international
whodunit
by
the
owner
of
munich
s
hotel
edenwolff
who
said
that
the
s.a.o
leader
had
checked
in
there
theprevious
night
three
hours
after

had
registered
said
thehotelman

men
entered
the

and
sent
a
note
up
to
his
room
.argoud
came
down
and
spoke
to
his
visitors
who
showed
him
something
.all
three
started
out
the
door
together
but
then
argoud
tried
to
pullaway
the
other
two
grabbed
him
hauled
him
out
to
the
street
knockedhim
down
threw
him
into
an
auto
and
drove
away
at
the
height
ofmunich
s
riotous
pre
lenten
celebrations
any
policeman
might
haveshrugged
it
off
as
just
another
fasching
brawl
.legendary
beards
as
they
read
the
headlines
parisians
began
toquestion
the
official
version
that
argoud
had
been
betrayed
by
thes.a.o
how
had
he
been
smuggled
from
germany
into
france
was
thephone
call
really
from
an
s.a.o
man
could
pierre
chateau
jobert
though
supposed
to
be
argoud
s
rival
for
leadership
of
the
founderings.a.o.
really
have
betrayed
a
comrade
in
this
way
the
newspapersplunged
gleefully
into
the
guessing
game
argoud
they
said
had
beencaptured
by
les
barbouzes
the
bearded
ones
the
legendary
triggermenof
the
french
secret
services
it
was
speculated
that
the
esmeraldaphone
call
was
simply
the
government
s
way
of
establishing
an
alibiafter
its
agents
had
illegally
kidnaped
argoud
in
germany
.argoud
s
attorney
pointedly
cited
twosimilar
illegal
kidnapings
that
of
adolf
eichmann
by
theisraelis
and
even
more
to
the
point
that
of
the
emigre
duked
enghien
who
suspected
of
plotting
against
napoleon
was
snatched
ingermany
by
french
police
and
then
tried
and
executed
whatever
thetruth
of
the
matter
parisians
agreed
that
l
affaire
argoud
was
trulyrocambolesque
incredible
to
cap
it
police
last
week
rounded
up
nineother
s.a.o
men
in
a
paris
apartment
charged
them
with
havingplanned
though
they
failed
even
to
attempt
the
assassination
ofpremier
georges
pompidou
last
year
argoud
s
arrest
had
another
result
it
caused
a
one
day
adjournment
in
the
trial
of
nine
defendants
time
feb
22
accused
of
being
part
of
the
gang
that
tried
to
killde
gaulle
at
petit
clamart
meanwhile
the
government
will
seek
toestablish
that
argoud
was
a
member
of
the
council
of
nationalresistance
which
ordered
the
ambush
at
petit
clamart
and
the
rest
offrance
will
keep
guessing
who
accomplished
argoud
s
capture
