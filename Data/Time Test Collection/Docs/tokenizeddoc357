the
magic
word
at
first
it
seemed
likeanother
in
the
long
series
of
racial
incidents
in
the
armed
forces
itbegan
one
evening
as
a
group
of
negro
soldiers
of
the
557thquartermaster
company
were
returning
to
their
barracks
at
the
big
u.s
.airbase
at
evreux
62
miles
west
of
paris
across
the
road
lay
anotherbarracks
housing
the
317th
supply
squadron
where
the
airmen
werewinding
up
a
g.i
party
that
is
a
cleanup
before

sinspection
death
at
dawn
the
negroes
passing
by
were
noisy
andsomeone
shouted
at
them
from
a
second
story
window
of
the
supplysquadron
barracks
no
one
knows
who
did
the
shouting
no
one
agreeson
what
was
shouted
but
unquestionably
the
shouts
contained
whatnegro
soldiers
at
evreux
call
the
magic
word
nigger
rushing
intotheir
own
barracks
the
negroes
grabbed
12in
metal
rods
used
totransform
beds
into
bunks
and
raced
across
the
street
first
there
wasmuch
pushing
shouting
and
loud
argument
then
a
fight
broke
out
lasting
approximately
30
seconds
when
it
was
over
six
white
airmenwere
hospitalized
with
head
wounds
none
of
the
injuries
seemedserious
but

even
so
there
was
a
debate
at

as
to
whether
or
not
the
fatal
brawl
wasindeed

were

the

you
could
take

across

add
up

more
doubt
was
cast
on
the
racial
implications
of
the
fight
when
asixth
member
of
the
quartermaster
company
was
arrested
and
also
chargedwith
homicide
and
aggravated
assault
he
was
a

had
