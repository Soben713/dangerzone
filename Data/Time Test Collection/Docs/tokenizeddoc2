who
s
in
charge
here
it
was
in
1954
that
nikitakhrushchev
launched
his
grandiose
virgin
lands
gamble
part
of
theplan
was
to
plow
up
32
million
acres
of
marginal
land
in
kazakhstan
and
settle
it
with
communist
pioneers
who
were
to
plant
andproduce
huge
quantities
of
desperately
needed
grain
within
two
years
.nikita
s
scheme
flopped
there
was
not
enough
rainfall
and
thepioneers
did
not
take
to
tractor
life
on
the
bleak
frontier
exceptfor
1958
each

been

than
the
previous
year
s
worstyear
of
all
was
1962
when
the
virgin
lands
delivered
only
half
theirquotas
naturally
khrushchev
takes
none
of
the
blame
for
the
fiasco
.three
years
ago
he
found
a
scapegoat
in
kazakhstan
party
boss
nikolaibelyaev
fired
him
for
his
errors
last
week
belyaev
s
successor
dinmukhamed
kunaev
was
similarly
bounced
for
lapses
in
his
work
.for
good
measure
moscow
also
purged
the
former
premier
of
theterritory
from
the
local
party
s
central
committee
it
was
perhaps
nocoincidence
that
nikolai
ignatov

a
onetime

left
his
