senegal
briefly
sympathetic
one
might
say
that
things
were
riggedin
advance
when
ex
premier
mamadou
dia
went
on
trial
last
week
forattempting
to
seize
power
in
december
after
all
six
of
the
seven
judges
were
members
of
the
national
assembly
that
dia
had
tried
todissolve
by
force
during
the
abortive
coup
they
just
might
be
alittleprejudiced
but
when
the
proceedings
began
the
court
was
careful
toobserve
all
the
flowery
decorum
of
gallic
justice
the
presiding
judgewas
resplendent
in
erminetrimmed
long
red
robes
and
sat
listening
withcalm
dignity
moreover
dia
was
not
even
charged
with
plotting
only
with
the
more
vague
acting
against
the
internal
security
of
thestate
taking
the
floor
in
his
own
defense
dia
argued
that
he
wasnot
guilty
of
the
charges
when
he
sent
gendarmes
to
overthrowpresident
leopold
senghor
and
arrest
pro
senghor
deputies
dia
said
hewas
only
trying
to
head
off
a
plot
against
himself
that
stemmed
fromhis
efforts
to
crack
senegal
s
peanut
monopolists
cried
dia
iwanted
a
constitutional
solution
they
senghor
s
men
wanted
apolitical
one
in
reply
the
prosecutor
sounded
downrightsympathetic
there
were
extenuating
circumstances
he
agreed
diawas
obviously
a
misguided
patriot
who
thought
that
one
could
not
be
agood
senegalese
when
one
was
against
mamadou
dia
but
at
week
s
endthe
court
gaveled
an
end
to
courtliness
after
two
hours
and
15minutes
of
deliberation
the
justices
sentenced
dia
to
the
maximumpenalty
life
imprisonment
