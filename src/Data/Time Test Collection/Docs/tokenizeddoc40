u.s
ambassador
adlai
stevensonoften
hears
the
argument
of
new
nations
that
democracy
is
a
luxury
theycannot
afford
stevenson
can
make
a
good
case
to
the
contrary
as
heshowed
last
week
in
an
eloquent
address
in
manhattan
before
the
centerfor
the
study
of
democratic
institutions
there
is
preciouslittle
dignity
or
equality
in
our
natural
state
most
human
beingshave
to
spend
their
lives
in
utter
vulnerability
all
are
bornunequal
in
terms
of
capacity
or
strength
and
survive
only
throughthe
restraint
shown
by
more
powerful
neighbors
for
nearly
3
000
years
western
man
has
struggled
to
create
a
social
order
in
which
weak
fallible
obstinate
silly
magnificent
man
can
exercise
his
free
andresponsible
choice
whether
democracy
can
prevail
in
the
greatupheaval
of
our
time
is
a
valid
question
we
have
good
reason
to
knowhow
clumsy
slow
inefficient
and
costly
it
is
compared
to
thecelerity
certainty
and
secrecy
of
absolutism
but
the
important
thingis
that
it
has
survived
the
important
thing
is
that
even
theabsolutists
masquerade
as
democrats
even
the
military
andquasi
military
dictatorships
strive
in
the
name
of
democracy
to
managethe
public
business
and
all
of
them
say
that
authoritarianism
is
onlya
necessary
transition
to
democracy
the
enemies
of
freedom
whatever
the
magnificent
ends
they
propose
the
brotherhood
of
man
thekingdom
of
saints
from
each
according
to
his
ability
to
eachaccording
to
his
needs
miss
just
this
essential
point
that
man
isgreater
than
the
social
purposes
to
which
he
can
be
put
he
must
notbe
kicked
about
even
with
the
most
high
minded
objectives
he
is
not
ameans
or
an
instrument
he
is
an
end
in
himself
this
is
theessence
of
what
we
mean
by
democracy
not
so
much
voting
systems
orparliamentary
systems
or
economic
or
legal
systems
though
they
allenter
in
as
an
irrevocable
and
final
dedication
to
the
dignity
of
man.in
this
sense
democracy
is
perhaps
mankind
