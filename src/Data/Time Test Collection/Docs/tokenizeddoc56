that
pudgy
and
popular
fellow
has
been
itching
to
get
hishands
on
the
top
job
in
west
germany
and
can
hardly
wait
forchancellor

to
retire
as

rapped
harshly
on

last

puffed
up
his
chest
and
tried
again

a

ludwig
declared
his
willingness
to
take
over
right
now
iwould
be
ready
to
accept
a
call
to
the
chancellorship
if
my

andthe
bundestag
so
decided
he
announced
clearly
hoping
that
othersfelt
as
he
did
after
all
many
of
west
germany
s
restive
politicianshad
been
grumbling
over
charles
de

s
courtship
of
der

wondering
whether
the
price
of
germany
s
new
friendship
treaty
withfrance
was
an
unacceptable
subservience
to

and
whether
itrequired
siding
with
the
french
against
both

and
the
u.s
nosupport
but
when
erhard
sat
back
to
listen
for
the
expected
cries
ofsupport
there
was
nothing
but
silence
he
had
overreached
himself
.at
the
first
cabinet
meeting
after
erhard
gave
out
hisreadiness
to
serve
interview
konrad
adenauer
simply
smiled
and
agreedwith
every
complaint
poor
ludwig
could
think
of
would
the
chancellorflatly
endorse
britain
s
entry
into
the
common
market
he
demanded
.of

adenauer
agreed
blandly
would
adenauer
declare
that
natoand
close
relations
with
the
u.s
were
the
basis
of
bonn
s
diplomacy
naturally
smiled

then
came

himself
from

ideas
of
creating
a

never
even
discussed
such

with
him
besides
west

is
opposed
to
such
a
policy
running

looked
around
the

mercilessly
