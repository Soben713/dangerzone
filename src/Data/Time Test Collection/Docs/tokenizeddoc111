communists
getting
together
despise
the
enemystrategically
wrote
mao
tse
tung
in
his
handbook
forrevolutionaries
but
take
him
seriously
tactically
last
week
drawing
a
bead
on
his
enemy
in
the

mao
did
both
he
made
histactical
point
by
accepting
moscow
s
call
for
bilaterial
negotiationsover
the
sino
soviet
rift
and
inviting
nikita
khrushchev
to
peking
the
communist
movement
has
reached
a
critical
juncture
the
time
hascome
when
differences
have
to
be
settled
declared
the
red
chinese
proposing
that
russia
s
premier
stop
off
in
peking
on
the
way
tocambodia
where
a
state
visit
by
khrushchev
has
been
discussed
for
sometime
alternatively
suggested
mao
a
red
chinese
delegation
could
goto
moscow
to
discuss
the
squabble
but
the
haughty
patronizing
toneof
the
message
offering
to
meet
the
soviets
only
on
the
basis
offull
equality
and
repeating
the
old
demands
for
a
one
waycompromise
would
make
it
tough
for
russia
to
accept
even
in

of
a
meeting

expert
we
can
expect
