a
grotesque
lump
of
a
man
emerged
from
the
medieval
romancatholic
church
in
corsica
s
olive
growing
village
of
sartene
.barefoot
masked
in
a
blood
red
hood
with
eye
slits
the
bent
figurestaggered
under
the
weight
of
a
massive
oak
cross
from
his
rightankle
dragged
a
clanking
31
lb
chain
and
from
under
the
hood
camean
anguished
muffled
chant
perdonno
mio
dio
perdonno
thus
as
it
has
every
spring
since
the
middle
ages
began
one
of
theworld
s
most
brutally
powerful
easter
week
processions
the
hoodedfigure
was
that
of
a
conscience
stricken
french
sinner
whose
identitywas
known
only
to
the
local
curate
father
jean
baptiste
scuitti
fromwherever
he
had
come
the
man
was
there
voluntarily
to
atone
for
hissins
by
enacting
the
role
of
christ
making
his
way
to
calvary
tocorsicans
as
always
he
was
known
only
as
le
catenacciu
the
enchainedone
so
popular
is
the
part
that
it
is
booked
solid
for
the
next
40years
by
applicants
from
as
far
away
as
madagascar
the
list
includesgamblers

all
seeking
peace
of

an
awful

is
no
evening
promenade
in
last
week
s
mock
trip
tocalvary
a
short
fat
man
grunted
and
puffed
as
he
bore
the
cross
alonga
mile
and
a
half
route
coming
out
of
the
church
the
catenacciu
gothis
huge
load
stuck
in
the
doorway
then
as
he
stumbled
along
dirtpaths
and
darkened
cobbled
streets
struggled
painfully
up
flights
ofancient
granite
stairs
his
bare
feet
began
to
bleed
throngs
ofvillagers
and
15
000
tourists
in
sartene
for
the
occasion
gatheredalong
the
route
to
jeer
three
times
the
catenacciu
fell
under
hisburden
and
each
time
a
fellow
penitent
playing
the
part
of
simon
ofcyrene
whispered
fiercely
get
up
you
asked
for
this
atlast
it
was
all
over
and
as
the
enchained
one
was
whisked
away
infather

were
lit
in
