was
convinced
that
the
egyptian

brought
a

but
there
was
a
more
concrete
reason
forthe
disappointment
nasser
took
with
him
last
week
when
he
pulled
upanchor
and
sailed
away
three
days
earlier
than

they
had
much
in

and

was
duly
grateful
to
nasser
for
his
aid
in
the
long
struggleagainst

but
at

nasser
found
ben

tobe
no
fawning
disciple
cool
tough
and
independent
the

more
interested
in
their
