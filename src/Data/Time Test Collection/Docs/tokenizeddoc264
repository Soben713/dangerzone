greece
the
king
wants
to
travel
the
king
was
working
in
thegarden
he
seemed
very
glad
to
see
me
we
walked
through
the
garden
.this
is
the
queen
he
said
she
was
clipping
a
rose
bush
oh
how
doyou
do
she
said
we
sat
down
at
a
table
under
a
big
tree
and
the
kingordered
whiskey
and
soda
we
have
good
whiskey
anyway
he
said
itwas
very
jolly
we
talked
for
a
long
time
like
all
greeks
he
wantedto
go
to
america
thus
in
just
about
the
shortest
story
he
everwrote
ernest
hemingway
40
years
ago
described
king
constantine
andqueen
sophia
as
they
were
clinging
to
the
unstable
throne
of
greece
.last
week
constantine
s
son
king
paul
was
also
in
his
gardened
palaceat
tatoi
outside
athens
and
the
whiskey
was
still
good
but
unlikehis
father
paul
did
not
want
to
go
to
america
he
wanted
to
go
tobritain
and
his
premier
would
not
let
him
thereby
precipitating
afirst
class
political
crisis
private
refuge
the
petty
seeming
issueof
the
trip
is
actually
part
of
a
wider
more
complex
problem
premierconstantine
karamanlis
56
is
a
tough
staunchly
anti
communist
pro
nato
politician
who
in
his
eight
years
in
office
the
longesttenure
for
any
greek
prime
minister
has
given
his
country
stablegovernment
and
a
considerable
measure
of
economic
progress
butleftists
and
liberals
attack
him
for
allegedly
having
rigged
the
1961elections
which
returned
him
to
power
for
a
fourth
term
and
forkeeping
about
1
000
political
prisoners
jailed
who
were
arrested
morethan
15
years
ago
during
the
country
s
bitter
and
victorious
war
withred
insurgents
communists
and
well
meaning
liberals
outside
greece
particularly
in
britain
this
year
started
a
concerted
campaign
againstthe
karamanlis
regime
and
against
the
royal
family
notably
queenfrederika
who
was
accused
of
nazi
connections
bertrand
russell
sban
the
bombers
joined
the
fray
and
last
april
when
frederika
was
inlondon
for
the
wedding
of
her
third
cousin
princess
alexandra
she
wasset
upon
by
a
crowd
of
demonstrators
and
forced
to
seek
refuge
in
aprivate
house
britain
s
anti
greek
chorus
was
swelled
by
lordbeaverbrook
who
for
reasons
of
his
own
scurrilously
attacked
her
inhis
newspapers
for
her
german
background
with
all
this
in
mind
karamanlis
advised
the
king
belatedly
against
a
planned
state
visit
tobritain
in
july
there
might
be
similar
incidents
during
the
trip
hesaid
and
the
greek
rightists
resenting
left
wing
attacks
abroad
might
make
trouble
too
as
they
did
in
salonika
recently
where
aleft
wing
member
of
the
greek
parliament
was
killed
the
king
splaintive
rejoinder
was
that
he
had
accepted
the
invitation
long
agoand
it
would
be
ungentlemanly
to
back
out
now
the
british
hadpromised
adequate
security
besides
he
did
not
want
to
appear
to
givein
to
pressure
from
the
left
king
paul
was
reinforced
by
pert
queenfrederika
who
like
her
great
great
grandmother
queen
victoria
strongly
feels
that
she
knows
better
than
her
ministers
what
is
goodfor
her
country
embarrassing
reds
rebuffed
karamanlis
handed
inhis
resignation
usually
known
as
loyal
to
the
king
he
wasnevertheless
trying
to
put
the
royal
family
in
its
place
because
ofwidespread
feeling
in
greece
that
they
have
taken
a
somewhat
too
activepart
in
politics
of
late
at
the
same
time
karamanlis
was
trying
tobring
about
new
elections
confident
that
his
national
radical
union
which
holds
180
of
300
seats
in
parliament
would
be
victorious
.instead
of
calling
elections
however
king
paul
at
week
s
end
wasattempting
to
patch
up
a
coalition
of
present
parties
in
parliament
the20
communist
members
out
of
dislike
of
karamanlis
are
embarrassinglybehind
the
king
but
the
attempt
is
doomed
to
failure
unless
some
ofkaramanlis
deputies
join
the
coalition
karamanlis
seemed
undisturbedby
the
royal
maneuvering
they
are
trying
to
break
up
my
party
hesaid
scornfully
snapping
one
finger
across
his
palm
he
added
but
i
have
got
my
party
like
that
meanwhile
without
a
government
the
king
and
queen
quite
literally
did
not
know
whether
to
stay
intheir
garden
at
tatoi
or
start
packing
for
their
trip
under
the
greekconstitution
the
monarch
cannot
leave
the
country
without
the
consentof
his
government
