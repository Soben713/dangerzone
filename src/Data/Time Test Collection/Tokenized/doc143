one
day
in
march
1959
in
thebritish
central
africa
protectorate
of
nyasaland
harmless
lookingelard
chipandale
31
tied
a
handful
of
magic
twigs
about
his
waist
donned
a
coat
of
tree
bark
and
turned
himself
into
a
crocodile
helay
in
wait
by
the
bank
of
the
mwanza
river
for
an
eight
year
old
girlnamed
mponda
simenti
when
mponda
ambled
by
on
the
way
to
fetch
waterfor
her
family
elard
the
crocodile
dragged
her
into
the
river
brokeher
arm
with
his
lashing
tail
and
finished
her
off
with
hisfinger
long
teeth
this
was
elard
s
own
mystical
version
of
what
somemight
consider
merely
a
case
of
murder
for
pay
the
girl
sgrandfather
odreck
kasoci
had
sought
out
elard
to
get
rid
of
theannoying
child
because
elard
was
well
known
in
the
neighborhood
as
a
magic
man
and
therefore
qualified
to
deal
with
the
problem
odreckagreed
to
pay
13.50
for
the
assassination
but
when
the
deed
was
done
he
reneged
chipandale
sued
in
a
native
court
for
his
fee
and
won
.but
a
government
policeman
happened
in
on
the
proceedings
and
reportedthe
two
men
last
week
in
nyasaland
s
commercial
center
of
blantyreboth
men
were
on
trial
for
murder
elard
s
ready
admission
of
thekilling
did
not
make
things
any
easier
for
chief
justice
sir
edgarunsworth
for
elard
insisted
that
he
was
not
guily
because
he
was
acrocodile
at
the
time
sir
edgar
called
in
the
government
spsychiatrist
to
test
elard
s
sanity
he
was
judged
not
insane
but
thepsychiatrist
added
we
must
admit
we
are
dealing
with
a
mentalitycompletely
foreign
to
us
sir
edgar
turned
to
the
court
assessorsthree
tribal
elders
for
expert
guidance
are
you
satisfied
heasked
that
the
prosecution
has
established
that
elard
was
not
onaccount
of
his
superstitious
belief
under
the
delusion
that
he
was
acrocodile
the
three
were
unanimous
in
their
answer
he
turnedhimself
into
a
magic
crocodile
and
seized
the
child
sir
edgar
wasfaced
with
another
classic
clash
of
white
man
s
rules
with
deeprootedafrican
beliefs
since
the
two
could
not
be
resolved
sir
edgar
wasforced
to
make
his
decision
on
the
basis
of
social
patterns
he
couldunderstand
ignoring
the
elders
testimony
he
sentenced
both
men
tobe
hanged
