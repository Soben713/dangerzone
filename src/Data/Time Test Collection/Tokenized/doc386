balance
of

a
chubby
little
man
in
a
darkblue
suit
strode
into
the

the
steamy
cambodiancapital

pronounced

pen
last
week
mounted
theplatform
and
began
haranguing
the
assembled
crowd
in
a
whiny
high
pitched
voice
the
speaker
was
prince
norodom
sihanouk
neutralist
mercurial
ruler
of
cambodia
and
he
had
called
the
rally
toannounce
in
effect
that
the
u.s
was
working
to
undermine
his
regime
.turning
theatrically
to
the
throng
sihanouk
asked
whether
the
nationalhonor
did
not
demand
that
cambodia
reject
any
future
help
from
theamericans
when
his
subjects
roared
obedient
approval
the
princeordered
so
be
it
sihanouk
might
change
his
mind
again
as
hehas
before
in
a
formal
note
to
washington
he
called
for
a
halt
toall
american
economic
and
military
aid
which
in
the
past
eight
yearshas
amounted
to
366
million
and
so
the
u.s
already
striving
tosave

faced

the
prince
a
suspicious
emotional
french
educateddescendant
of
cambodia
s
medieval
khmer
kings
he
once
performedslapstick
parts
in
movies
which
he
produced
himself
and
has
oftenplayed
slapstick
politics
friends
seriously
reported
last
week
thattwo
contributing
reasons
for
sihanouk
s
bad
mood
might
be
that
1
hehad
been
crash
dieting
to
lose
15
lbs
in
ten
days
and

the

.transferred
a
former
military
advisory
chief

whom
the
princeenjoyed

the
prince
himself
accused
the
u.s
ofsupporting
a
clandestine
radio
on
south
viet
nam
soil
run
by
theprince
s
political
opposition
the
u.s
denied
the
charge
.but
above
all
theprince
talks
of
the
inevitability
of

ofsoutheast

hence
may
be
trying
to
save
himself
by
cozying
up
tothe

what
precipitated
his
latest
performance
could
wellhave
been
the
overthrow
and
assassination
of
his
late
neighbor
southviet
nam
s
ngo
dinh
diem
although
sihanouk
and
diem
were
bitterenemies
the
prince
was
shaken
by
diem
s
death
and
attributed
it
to
thecutoff
of
diem
s
american
aid
possibly
determined
never
to
gethimself
on
the
same
vulnerable
spot
sihanouk
moved
quickly
to
lessenhis
dependence
on
the
u.s
opening
to
the
seine
for
all
hiseccentric
behavior
sihanouk
has
also
sometimes
proved
himself
a
shrewdpolitician
since
independence
from
france
ten
years
ago
he
hasjailed

wooed

while
at
the

time
maintaining

with

and
red
china
sihanouk
last
week
performedanother
typically
slippery
gyration
instead
of
rushing
right
intopeking
s
arms
he
turned
to
his
old
colonial
tutor
france
and
askedher
to
help
replace

said
the
prince
for
our
country
liberated
from
the
u.s
and
which
the
communist
powers
do
not
wish
totake
in

it
could

the

his

theatrics
by
calling

delivering
a
meandering
monologue
interspersed
with
giggles
proudly
he
announced
that

had
offered
him
military
support
ithink
i
have
achieved
a
balance
of

he
said
the
menace
ofthe
imperialists
and
their
lackeys
is
counterbalanced
by
the
menace
ofcommunist
china
our
no

he
indicated
that
he
wouldhave
only
four
