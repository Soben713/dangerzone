war
to
moscow
with
caution
the
pattern
of
arrival
anddeparture
might
be
symbolic
by
week
s
end
everyone
in
moscow
believedthat
the
red
chinese
delegation
was
ready
to
head
home
before
too
long.
at
the
same
time
u.s
and
british
delegations
were
due
to
arrive
.the
russians
were
jamming
radio
peking
but
let
the
voice
of
americacome
in
loud
and
clear
faced
with
the
open
chinese
challenge
tosoviet
leadership
of

communism
nikita
khrushchev
may
want
toease
tensions
with
the
west
both
to
bulwark
his
position
at
home
andto
demonstrate
the
genuineness
of
his
much
heralded
coexistence
policyabroad
but
whether
khrushchev
wants
it
badly
enough
to
make
somereally
meaningful
concessions
is
still
another
question
the
issues
.as
he
flew
off
to
moscow
for
another
round
of
test
ban
talks
presidential
envoy
averell
harriman
noted
hopefully
that
russia
wasbeing
more
pleasant
in
the
small
things
of
life
as
for
the
bigthings
we
are
going
in
good
faith
and
in
the
hope
of
achieving
somesteps
that
will
be
beneficial
the
principal
issues
facing
harrimanand
his
fellow
negotiator
british
minister
of
science
viscounthailsham
in
moscow
.test
ban
khrushchev
has
indicated
that
hewould
revive
russia
s
1961
terms
for
a
test
ban
which
included
avoluntary
moratorium
on
underground
detonations
without
effectivecontrols
this
proposal
was
rejected
by
the
u.s
at
the
time
.then
last
year
russia
offeredto
permit
three
inspections
of
its
territory
yearly
by
way
of
policingan
underground
ban
moscow
subsequently
reneged
khrushchev
nowinsists
that
russia
will
never
open
its
door
to
nato
spies
andthat
this
is
no
subject
for
bargaining
the
west
will
not
acceptan
unenforceable
moratorium
on
underground
tests
since
it
believesthat
the
russians
would
break
it
at
will
as
they
violated
thevoluntary
test
ban
in
1961
however
if
russia
agrees
to
a
treaty
thatsimply
forbids
tests
in
the
atmosphere
which
are
easily
detectable
thewest
is
willing
to
take
up
the
problem
of
underground
testing
at
alater
date
.nonaggression
pact
khrushchev
declared
that
at
theconclusion
of
a
testban
agreement
he
will
revive
russia
s
hoarydemand
for
a
nonaggression
pact
between
the
15
nato
powers
and
thesatellite
nations
of
the
warsaw
treaty
in
the
past
this
proposal
hasinvariably
been
rejected
by
the
west
because
west
germany
and
franceobject
that
it
would
imply
western
acceptance
of
a
divided
europe
andrecognition
of
east
germany
in
any
case
they
point
out
no
suchdeclaration
is
needed
for
nato
s
defensive
purposes
were
guaranteed
inits
charter
14
years
ago
the
prospects
u.s
policymakers
emphasizethat
a
test
ban
treaty
would
have
little
if
any
effect
on
the
balanceof
power
since
both
east
and
west
have
more
than
enough
nuclearwarheads
for
any
conceivable
conflict
the
only
way
either
side
couldgain
a
decisive
strategic
lead
would
be
through
a
major
breakthrough
inmissile
delivery
systems
which
would
not
be
covered
by
the
test
ban
.in
any
case
nuclear
technology
is
now
so
advanced
that
weapons
such
asthe
anti
missile
missile
can
be
developed
entirely
in
the
laboratory
.furthermore
no
western
statesman
believes
that
a
test
ban
agreementwill
restrain
the
french
or
chinese
from
testing
nuclear
weapons
atwill
or
even
slow
the
spread
of
nuclear
arms
to
other
nations
why
then
is
the
west
so
eager
to
sign
a
nuclear
pact
with
russia
rightly
or
wrongly
washington
has
come
to
view
a
test
ban
treaty
asthe
touchstone
of
soviet
intentions
if
this
one
outstanding
issue
canbe
resolved
after
five
years
of
frustration
the
state
departmentbelieves
then
there
is
hope
that
east
and
west
may
ultimately
be
ableto
settle
other
issues
though
harriman
is
empowered
only
to
negotiatea
test
ban
agreement
he
expects
to
explore
other
cold
warproblems
such
as
berlin
and
russia
s
failure
to
enforce
the
laotianneutrality
pact
on
those
matters
khrushchev
