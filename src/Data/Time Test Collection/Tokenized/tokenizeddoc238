resentment
against

finally
exploded
after
a
fistfight
between
anindonesian
student
and
a
chinese
student
at
bandung
s
institute
oftechnology
when
a
youthful
rioter
was
shot
by

in

town
mobs
with

herded
chinese
from

and
made

throng
in

police
brought
down
a

electrocuted
two
indonesians
prone

enjoy
predictably
indonesia
s
president
sukarno
blamed
neither
himself
nor
his
chaoticeconomic
policies
for
the
riots
said
that
they
were
caused
by
counter
revolutionaries
trying
to
capitalize
on
the
food
and
clothingsituation
and
on
the
chinese
minority
problem
he
went
right
aheadwith
plans
to
squeeze
out
western
oil
companies
though
in
the
processhe
risked
losing
the
source
of
onethird
of
his
nation
s
total
exportearnings
not
one
to
be
disturbed
long
by
mere
economic
questions
sukarno
was
more
interested
in
tenure
so
as
to
be
able
to
cope
withany
future
disorders
he
had
his
rubber
stamp
congress
appoint
himto
the
presidency
for
life
this
decision
might
not
entirely
live
upto
certain
constitutional
requirements
harrumphed
an
indonesiancabinet
minister
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
it
is
a
politicalrevolutionary
product
and
not
a
legalistic
product
with
hiscontinued
career
thus
assured
sukarno
flew
off
for
what
was
describedas
a
long
rest
in
japan
belgrade
vienna
rome
and
france
which
heis
always
prone
to
enjoy
