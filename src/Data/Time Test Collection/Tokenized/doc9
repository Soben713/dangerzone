thelong
forgotten
chats
of
the

of
his

britain
s
interests
the
charge
of
progermansympathies
has
often
been
made
against
the
german
descended
duke
ofwindsor
most
notably
after
the
publication
of
other
captured
nazidocuments
five
years
ago
the
london
daily
express
dismissed
the
lateduke
of
coburg
s
account
as
having
no
value
as
evidence
because
hewas
a
nazi
spreading
news
he
knew
would
be
welcome
in
berlin
butthe
daily
mirror
s
columnist
cassandra
seemed
convinced
of
windsor
s
close
and
cordial
relationships
with
the
nazi
regime
at
week
s
endthe
duke
of
windsor
now
68
denied
most
but
not
all
of
the
publishedreports
they
give
a
generally
false
impression
he
declared
in
astatement
issued
by
his
secretary
in
france
adding
it
must
beremembered
that
the
duke
with
the
majority
of
the
people
who
had
theinterests
of
great
britain
at
heart
was
striving
for
someunderstanding
with
germany
