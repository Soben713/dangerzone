as

since

last

of

had
every
reason
to
believe
that
hewould
inherit
the

of

no

really
says

but
at
apress
conference
last
week
jammed
with
reporters
and
tv
cameras
wilson
set
out
smoothly
and
competently
to
leave
the
right
impression
.he
regretted
the
tragic
event
of
gaitskell
s
death
that
createdthis
vacancy
he
diplomatically
declared
that
a
great
deal
ofcredit
must
go
to
george
brown
for
keeping
the
party
together
in
theinterim
finally
wilson
stated
his
three
main
objectives
first
to
maintain
the
unity
of
the
party
that
hugh
gaitskell
handed
on
second
to
continue
those
policies
worked
out
under
his
leadership
.thirdly
to
lead
the
party
to
victory
in
the
coming
general
election
in
the
past
decade
labor
s
strength
has
been
sapped

the

finds
itself

in

the
reaction
to

is
generally
one
ofuneasy
suspicion
and
he
is
frequently
accused
of
being

the
need
to
give
labor
a
twentiethcentury
look
mr
wilson
has
been
consistently
ambiguous
indeeddeliberately
and
cleverly
so
these
are
the
reasons
for
more
thandoubt
about
his
leadership
having
quit
the
labor
cabinet
in
1951
along
with
firebrand
aneurin
bevan
wilson
has
inherited
much
ofbevan
s
leftwing
support
but
in
the
cabinet
his
main
administrativeachievement
was
the
dismantling
of
a
vast
array
of
controls
onbritain
s
postwar
economy
he
has
always
been
more
pragmatic
thandoctrinaire
or
opportunistic
his
enemies
say
in
a
commons
speechlast
week
he
declared
what
i
am
saying
may
or
may
not
beideological
but
it
will
get
the
export
orders
with

left
safelyon
his
side
wilson
is
shrewd
enough
to
know
that
as
leader
he
mustnow
conciliate
the
party
s
center
and
right
wilson
carried
on
a
mildflirtation
with
the
h
bomb
unilateralists
when
he
challengedgaitskell
for
party
leadership
in
1960
and
for
a
time
plumped
forneutralism
instead
of
nato
last
week
wilson
reassured
everybody
thatthe
labor
party
stands
firmly
by
nato
and
he
added
we
shouldexpect
to
have
a
very
happy
relationship
with
washington
in
arecent
commons
speech
he
argued
that
britain
should
avoid
the
needlessexpense
of
a
separate
nuclear
deterrent
but
nevertheless
should
have
avoice
in
deciding
when
the
west
i.e.
the
u.s.
uses
its
nuclear
power
there
must
be
no
annihilation
without
representation
withhis
ready
tongue
and
sharp
mind
harold
wilson
will
prove
a
formidableadversary
for
prime
minister
harold
macmillan
he
was
swiftly
dubbed
the
other
harold
there
is
hardly
an
m.p
who
has
a
better
graspof
parliamentary
procedure
or
a
better
knack
of
turning
it
to
hisside
s
advantage
he
has
already
drawn
blood
with
his
slashing
attackson
the
vain
nuclear
posturing
of
the
macmillan
government
.macmillan
s
relations
with
u.s
president
john
kennedy
said
wilson
reminded
him
of
a
seedy
uncle
receiving
homilies
from
a
young
andwealthy
nephew
though
it
may
be
difficult
to
discover
precisely
whereharold
wilson
stands
there
was
little
doubt
last

about
where
heintends
