triplets
reunited
indonesia
malaya
and
thephilippines
are
triplets
who
became
separated
at
birth
who
wereplaced
under
the
care
of
different
foster
parents
but
who
have
now
comeof
age
and
are
trying
to
rediscover
their
common
origin
and
shape
theircommon
destiny
this
description
of
the
three
malay
states
wasoffered
last
year
by
philippine
president
diosdado
macapagal
inmanila
last
week
the
top
ministers
of
the
three
nations
made
plans
tobring
the
triplets
together
again
the
event
suggested
that
at
leastfor
the
time
being
cantankerous
indonesia
is
getting
to
be
a
moreresponsible
citizen
in
the
southeast
asia
neighborhood
the
newgrouping
would
loosely
join
indonesia
and
the
philippines
to
tunkuabdul
rahman
s
federation
of
malaysia
malaya
singapore
north
borneo
sarawak
and
brunei
to
be
established
aug
31
the
philippines
claima
part
of
north
borneo
as
its
own
but
agreed
amicably
to
postponesettlement
of
the
issue
indonesia
s
president
sukarno
who
hadcondemned
the
malaysia
federation
as
an
imperialist
plot
apparentlyrealized
that
since
he
can
t
stop
it
he
might
as
well
try
to
join
it
.most
surprising
item
in
the
manila
agreement
was
a
pledge
of
mutualdefense
against
subversion
in
any
form
or
manifestation
thispledge
is
aimed
not
only
at
communism
but
also
against
the
sizablechinese
minorities
who
dominate
the
industry
and
trade
of
southeastasia
still
any
anti
communist
step
is
remarkable
for
indonesia
.having
made
this
political
move
more
favorable
to
the
west
someobservers
expect
that
sukarno
will
soon
make
a
move
to
placate
redchina
next
step
