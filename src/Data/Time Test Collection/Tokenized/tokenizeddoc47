for

the

but
until
last
week
no

what
the

was
a

what

last

was
a

on

between

and

world
embracing

on

to

of

acting

that

become
a

bythe
scandinavian

the
defense
of
this

would
be

the

by

introverted

more
on

than
on

it
represents

the
historic
efforts

by

srivers

has

of
persuading

to
form

conceivably
de

at
one
point
might
have
been
weanedaway
from
his
dream
when
he
returned
to
power
in
1958
to
lead
afrance
still
riven
by
the
algerian
war
he
demanded
admission
to

directorate
of

but
the
idea
was
blackballed
byeisenhower
and
macmillan
he
probably
would
have
been
as
intransigentas
a
co
director
as
he
has
been
without
becoming
one
since
then
heprogressively
withdrew
french
ground
and
naval
forces
from

banished
u.s
nuclear
warheads
from
french
soil
and
sankbillions
of
francs
into
a
crash
program
to
create
a
nuclear
force
defrappe
of
his
own
as
of
last

the

admittedly
the

is
a
modest
operation
and
one
that
could
swiftly
be
knocked
outof
the
air
even
when
by
1965
the
french
hope
to
have
350

of
carrying

de
gaulle
concedes
that
hisnuclear
weaponry
will
never
match
the
gargantuan
and
lethal
stockpilesof
russia
and
the
u.s
but
he
thinks
that
it
is
big
enough
andmurderous
enough
to
give
any
potential
aggressor
pause
and
besides
itis
his
own
unfit

has

to
degaulle
s
jaundiced
eye
the
british
attempt
to
enter
the

simply
a
trojan
horse
maneuver
an
expression
used
with

in

editorials
and
salons
last

staged
bywashington
to
make
sure
that
the
u.s
domination
of

would
notbe
frustrated
britain
did
much
to
arrange
her
own
fate
in
1950
london
was
offered
membership
in
the
european
coal

seven
years
later
london
was
invited
to

and
again
refused

therunaway

during
the

first

of

de

was
not
actively
in

but
he
soonmade
it
clear
he
considered
the
british
as
suppliants
not

could
not

to
change

foolhardy

of

degaulle
s
determination

camejust

now
plainly
little
morethan
a

boy
for
le
grand
charles
it
is
being
said
that
webroke
off
the
negotiations
he
declared
in
reality
ourresponsibility
has
been
that
of
making
clear
that
the
negotiations
havebeen
taking
place
in
a
vacuum
since
october
and
of
having
said
that
itis
preferable
to
face
the
facts
then
he
echoed
the
boss
again
.when
britain
can
accept
all
the
requirements
of
the
treaty
of
rome
nothing
can
stop
her
from
entering
the
common

but
it
is
uponher
and
not
on
us
that
the
burden
of
proof
lies
it
would
have
beena
little
late
in
the
day
but
many
at
the
table
thought
that
it
wouldhave
been
wonderful
had
heath
given
in
entirely
at
this
point
and
takencouve
up
on
his
offer
with
no
more
haggling
but
the
briton
limitedhimself
to
a
dispassionate
rebuttal
it
has
been
contended
he
said
that
britain
is
not
european
enough
there
are
many
millions
ineurope
who
know
perfectly
well
how
european
britain
has
been
in
thepast
and
are
grateful
for
it
added
heath
the
truth
is
thatsome
people
regarded
the
negotiations
as
being
too
close
to
success
though
they
gave
other
reasons
for
breaking
them
off
when
hestopped

but

a
superb
instrument
for

strong
hand
to
wield

he
was
contemptuous
of
it
atthe
start
and
dismisses
the

work
for

have

paused

all
the
