the

our

full
of

our

the
emotional
side
of
me
tends
toimagine
france
like
the
princess
in
the
stories
or
the
madonna
in
thefrescoes
as
dedicated
to
an
exalted
and
exceptional
destiny
but
thepositive
side
of
my
mind
also
assures
me
that
france
is
not
reallyherself
unless
in
the
front
rank
that
only
vast
enterprises
arecapable
of
counterbalancing
the
divisive
ferments
which
are

who
in

faith
can
dispute
the
factthat
france
must
help
to
build

that
gradually
there
may
be
established

perhaps
it
might
be
possible
to
renew

even

i
am
convinced

if

thewhole

impression

integration
inwhich
the
defense

countries
of
continental
europe
apartfrom
england
has
no
national
character
in
which
in
fact
all
iscommanded
by
the
americans

it
is
the
americans
who
determine
theuse
of

the
american
interest
isnot
always
the
french
interest
this
will
be
more
and
more
true
in
thefuture
which
will
give
europe
a
greater
and
greater
weight
and
whichwill
therefore
contribute
