frantic
scurrying
ofa
great
many
odd
human
insects
one
of
the
crawliest
figures
to
emergewas
that
of
peter
rachman
who
may
or
may
not
be
dead
last
weekpress
and
parliament
were
abuzz
with
his
sordid
story
rachman
lookedthe
part
of
an
ian
fleming
villain
short
and
fat
with
grotesquelytiny
hands
and
feet
he
had
no
neck
a
bald
head
shaped
like
a
soccerball
and
sunken
blue
eyes
always
hidden
behind
dark
glasses
hedressed
flashily
wore
elevator
shoes
of
crocodile
leather
it
amusedhim
to
watch
naked
lady
wrestlers
and
he
had
a
fetish
about
hygiene
insisting
that
all
his
silverware
be
sterilized
and
untouched
by
humanhands
more
than
most
men
rachman
loved
money
and
women
white
chief.
in
1946
when
he
was
26
polish
born
rachman
had
arrived
in
britainvirtually
penniless
and
possessing
a
stateless
person
s
passport
atfirst
he
found
postwar
britain
a
bleak
place
his
english
was
poor
and
he
labored
as
kitchen
helper
insurance
agent
and
black
marketeer
.he
made
his
bid
for
fortune
in
the
early
1950s
by
borrowing
2
500
tobuy
a
lodging
house
near
london
s
harrow
road
the
house
cost
solittle
because
seven
of
its
eight
rooms
were
occupied
by
tenantsprotected
by
rent
control
and
immune
from
eviction
rachman
rented
theone
empty
room
to
a
party
of
eight
west
indian
musicians
who
wereencouraged
to
hold
nightlong
parties
and
raise
hell
they
did
tosuch
good
effect
that
the
seven
white
tenants
moved
out
within
threemonths
and
were
replaced
by
swarms
of
west
indians
paying
vastlyinflated
rents
eighteen
months
later
rachman
sold
the
house
for
fivetimes
what
he
had
paid
for
it
and
moved
on
to
further
real
estatetriumphs
in
the
rundown
areas
of
paddington
bayswater
and
notting
hill.
in
his
single
minded
effort
to
get
lowrent
tenants
out
of
his
housesand
highrent
tenants
in
rachman
hired
men
to
urinate
in
hallways
smash
furniture
and
once
in
bayswater
to
remove
the
roof
of
a
houseand
abandon
the
stubborn
tenants
to
the
mercy
of
wind
and
weather
inthe
underworld
he
got
the
name
of
polish
peter
and
west
indians
who
knew
his
power
called
him

lifted
all

andenabled
rachman
to
shoehorn
tenants
into
his

would
bear
he
also
showed
talent
for
