in

secret

to

had
agreedto
remove
the
biggest
obstacle
to

afterward
the

that
it
was

very
thing
that
khrushchev
had
demanded
when

him
to
get
his
medium

out
of

its

any

for
the

its
purpose
saidpresident
kennedy
is
simple
to
put
the

position
by

the

equally
remote
actually
khrushchev
first
agreed
to
theprinciple
of
on
site
inspections
way
back
in
1959
when
britain
s
primeminister
macmillan
was
in
moscow
only
to
shelve
it
after
he
broke
thethree
year
test
moratorium
in
1961
but
having
concluded
his
ownlatest
nuclear
test
series
khrushchev
doubtless
figures
that
he
haslittle
to
lose
from
an
effort
to
stop
all
testing
for
a
while
thetime
has
come
now
khrushchev
wrote
kennedy
just
before
christmas
to
put
an
end
once
and
for
all
to
nuclear
tests
we
are
ready
to
meetyou
halfway
to
nikita
halfway
meant
two
or
three
inspections
eachyear
to
investigate
suspicious
tremors
the
u.s
thought
that
eightinspections
would
be
the
minimum
having
whittled
that
down
from
itsoriginal
twelve
while
the
u.s
has
been
demanding
that
at
least
adozen
unmanned
seismic
detection
stations
or
black
boxes
beinstalled
on
soviet
soil
khrushchev
said
that

of

the

we
believe
he
concluded
that
now
theroad
to

is
straight
and
clear
atmospheric
noise
thiswas
clearly
not
kennedy
s
view
but
he
declared
himself
encouraged
suggested
that
exploratory
talks
be
held
and
after
they
got
started
ordered
a
halt
