even
through

the
austrian
government
has
been
run
jointlyby
the
conservative
people

party
and
the
socialist
party
like

equally

cousins
on
an
inert
seesaw
so
scrupulouslybalanced
is
the
coalition
and
the
proporz
system
of
dividing
up

after

s
elections
balancebecame
stalemate
the
two
big
parties
have
been
haggling
over
acabinet
ever
since
a
group
of
vociferous
people
s
party
reformersargued
for
less
of
the
traditional
cooperation
with
the
socialists
butthe
meager
victory
of
the
people
s
party
81
seats
to
76
for
thesocialists
was
hardly
a
mandate
for
sweeping

still
conservative
chancellor
alfons
gorbach
shared

one
in

the
foreign
ministry
where
socialistbruno
kreisky
was
the
prime
target
of
the
people
s

reformers
.the
conservatives
argued
that
a
socialist
could
not
possibly
put

into
the
vital
negotiations
for
austrian
associate

market
which
after

months
the
socialists
and

negotiatorsmet
almost
daily
in
the
ornate
ballhaus
