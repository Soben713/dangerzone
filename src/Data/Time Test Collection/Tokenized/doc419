leg
of

tired
the
ailing
67
year
old
chou
for
the
first
time
westerners
noticed
that
he
has
only
partial
use
of
his
right
arm
which
was
usually
clutched
tightly
over
his
stomach
at
one
point
after
climbing
a
flight
of
stairs
at
an

premier
staggered
off
into
a
corner
as
if
he
were
aboutto
faint
one
of
two
doctors
in
his
entourage
hurried
over
andappeared
to
give
him
a
whiff
of
smelling
salts
as
chou
raised
hishead
blood
trickled
from
his
nose
it
happens
whenever
he
getstired
shrugged
one
of
his
aides
it
is
not
serious
but
thatis
why
he
always
has
a
doctor
with
him
chou
nonetheless
hadplenty
of
energy
for
speechmaking
harped
repeatedly
on
the

indeed
tohear

the

will
bury
not
only
the
west
but
russia
aswell
the
asian
and
african
peoples

created
illustrious
civilizations
which
weredemolished
by
imperialist
aggression
and
tyranny
now
that
we
havebroken
the
imperialistic

we
will
be
able
to
work
newmiracles
for
all
his
eagerness
to
win
african
support
for

conflict
however
chou
could
offer
littlecash
to
the
underdeveloped
countries
in
some
areas
that
thechinese
have
cultivated
they
may
even
end
by
making
moreenemies
than

by
lending

20
million
