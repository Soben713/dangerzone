175

the
region
was
a
tangled
menacing
battleground
whose
name
like
tennyson
s
balaclava
derives
from
its
bloody
historyin
south
viet

s
ugly
guerrilla
war
as
each

dipped
into

an

sprayed
the

rockets
and
machine
gunfire
not
a

shot
was
returned
as
the
troops
hit
theground
and
fanned
into
the

the
absence
of
enemy
opposition
inthe
landing
area
could
be
largely
traced
to
viet

of

reluctantly
the

which

in

theirony
of
the

success
is
that
they
are
makeshift
killers
originally
designed
as
utility
aircraft
and
personnel

buthuey
pilots
became
convinced
that
their
speedy
maneuverable
chopperswould
be
ideal

aircraft
in
the
kind
of

homemade
rocket
mounts
and
fourmachine
gun
brackets
pestered
dubious
brass
for
months
to
let
them
tryout
their
ideas
in
action
the
hueys
effectiveness
is
mainly
theresult
of
their
ability
to
chug
right
along
in
the
same
formation
withthe
h
21s
unlike
fixed
wing
fighter
bombers
which
fly
too
high
andtoo
fast
to
pick
out
specific

and
sometimes
