bridging
the
past
principal
artery
of
commerce
in
thecongo
was
traditionally
the
congolese
national
route
a
1
725
milerail
riverrail
connection
from
elisabethville
in
katanga
to
theatlantic
gateway
at
matadi
but
the
route
became
unusable
with
theoutbreak
of
civil
war
whenever
katanga
s
secessionist
moise
tshombefelt
events
going
against
him
he
quickly
ordered
another
railroadbridge
blown
up
thus
since
1960
most
traffic
has
moved
on
alternaterail
lines
through
portuguese
angola
and
mozambique
but
the
routesacross
foreign
territory
soak
up
revenue
badly
needed
within
the
congo
and
last

adoula
hopefully
dedicated
a
new
railroadbridge
at
bukama
the
final
rebuilt
link
in
the
katanga
matadi
run
this
is
not
only
a
bridge
over
the
lualaba
river
said
adoula
itis
a
bridge
over
the
unhappy
past
though
a
milestone
of
sorts
thebukama
bridge
also
marks
the
petty
pace
of
congolese
unity
for

remains
an

as
the
mood
strikes

also
tribal

necessitate
frequent

of
