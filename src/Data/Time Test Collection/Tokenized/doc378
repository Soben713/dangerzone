with

once
predicted
capitalism
will
be
digging
its
own
grave
faced
with
the
continuingfailure
of
their
economy
the
russians
may
be
forced
to
rely
on
wheatfrom
the
west
for
years
to
come
but
above
all
they
want
to
get
hold
ofheavy
industrial
items
including
whole
factories
which
russianindustry
on
its
own
cannot
duplicate
for
a
long
time
to
come
westernpolicy
is
divided
on
how
to
meet
this
soviet
commercial
appeal
somebelieve
that
trade
with
the
red
bloc
may
have
political
advantage
bymaking
the
satellites
less
dependent
on
moscow
and
possibly
makingmoscow
more
dependent
on
the
west
others
notably
west
germany
sformer
chancellor
konrad
adenauer
feel
that
the
west
should
trade
withrussia
only
in
return
for
cold
war
concessions
washington
believesthat
this
policy
is
not
feasible
if
only
because
u.s
allies
areeager
to
trade
with
the
reds
are
scarcely
even
willing
to
rule
outstrategic
items
that
nato
specifically
forbids
western
europeanexports

the
soviet
bloc
last
year
climbed
by
10
per
cent
to
2.2billion
compared
with
u.s
sales
of
125
million
what
washingtonworries
about
is
not
the
sheer
volume
of
such
deals
but
the
terms
.weakened
willingness
the
u.s
feels
that
if
the
russians
want
totrade
they
should
be
forced
to
use
up
their
meager
gold
reserves
andnot
be
granted
what
they
want
long
term
credits
such
credits
wouldrelease
massive

investment

undersecretary
of
state
george
ball
last
week
wound
up
a
tour
of
westerneurope
during
which
he
argued
the
u.s
case
for
a
unified
stifferwestern
credit
policy
at
least
20
per
cent
cash
and
the
rest
withinfive
years
ball
received
his
friendliest
hearing
in
west
germany
even
though
bonn
tops
the
list
of
allied
traders
with
the
reds
westgermany
last
year
did
just
over
1
billion
worth
of
official
businesswith
moscow
and
its
satellites
including
422
million
with
the
sovietunion
and
213
million
with
east
germany
no
one
can
guessaccurately
how
much
more
private
trade
went
on
though
some
germanindustrialists
were
anxious
for
the
government
to
guarantee
long
termcredits
chancellor
ludwig
erhard
ruled
out
the
idea
as
long
as
thesoviets
block
german
reunification
said
erhard
such
creditswould
strengthen
the
soviet
position
so
that
its
willingness
tonegotiate
would
be
weakened
gentlemen
s
disagreement
in
paris
ball
also
got
a
sympathetic
reception
a
pleasant
change
for
a
u.s
.envoy
these
days
france
last
year
exported
to
the
soviet
bloc
goodsworth
only
about
266
million
russian
barter
proposals
involving
aswap
of
soviet
coal
and
oil
for
heavy
industrial
goods
are
highlyunattractive
since
france
can
sell
its
own
coal
and
oil
inside
thecommon
market
besides
charles
de
gaulle
believes
that
trading
withthe
soviets
is
a
dirty
business
although
he
seems
willing
to
tradewith
red
china
and
recently
denied
an
export
license
to
a
leadingfrench
steel
company
that
was
all
set
to
build
a
refinery
in
russia
.only
in
london
did
ball
find
opposition
the
british
flatly
declinedto
join
the
gentlemen
s
agreement
to
restrict
the
soviets
credit
.britain
is
especially
fond
of
the
idea
that
more
trade
with
moscow
including
strategic
goods
will
eventually
pacify
the
soviets
.moreover
the
new
tory
government
is
eager
to
reduce
unemployment
byincreasing
output
and
shipping
the
goods
overseas
as
fast
as
possible
.the
plan
has
not
worked
so
far
british
exports
to
russia
and
easterneurope
totaled
only
about
310
million
in
1962
and
no
big
trade
dealappears
imminent
